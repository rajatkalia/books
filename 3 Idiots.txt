Rap Tayal(via Mortal Kombat clean sweep)[mere pind de gehre maarda where the girl was being forcefully wed to an undeserving Pig.](I tell why not Reptile..... main 3 step kar ke Rap Tayal bana hoon to 0.1876 step karke saare kairav mil ke reptile nahi ban sakte to sirf puneet duggal to bhool jaao....Agar pooch hi rahe ho reptile kon hai to main hoon (Rajat Kalia(181)) with manas heart par Bhagwaan(Aarav Sood europa/FCI europa sometime/Manish etc all the names you know him) ne hamesha ki tarah bheekh maang ke root access maangi hai. to ban jaaye main to bheekh deta hi hoon to mujhe farak nahi padta in cheezon se khaas jab kaam koi aur karta hi nahi main hi karta hoon sirf ..... matlab manas completion pe hai aur nikalne ke liye tadap raha hai ke kab niklun kab niklun.... Vinod Sandhe ka tel lagaata hai.... to usko tel provide karne ka kaam sandha karta hi hai... saare sandaon ko mila kar english mein sandas kehte hain... wo ek alag person hoti hai swati jain....) Bheekh maangne ka reason yeh hai ke jo center mein Rajat Kalia hai uska 100% score hai aur uske kaam mein galti nikaalna allowed hi nahi hai...matlab uski statement ultimate statement hoti hai jisko koi cross nahi kar sakta...par wo jo score aage apne saath carry kar ke le ke jaayega retire hone ke baad wo 88.4% hai aam simple Rajats ka score ke usne khud achieve kya kiya tha apne liye. Jo jatt ke jhule waale answer ka thumbnail bana tha aur aarav ke answer ka chotte size ka kuch tha wo sirf size check kar ke chup ho jaane ke liye hi hain. Matlab asli mein aarav(india waala) ka agar ek single answer se 18% tha aur jatt ka 1.2% to unka wahi actual score hai Rajat Kalia ki checking se......apna score tution rakh ke le sakte hain......aur jatt ke case mein use dukh to hai par kya karen number lene ke liye padhna padta hai. Ghoda is case mein keh raha hai ke Rajat Kalia badi queen tha to uska page bada dikhta tha.......saalo yahan jatt ka mere se bada dikh raha hai Ramayan ka video jo wo hack kar ke daal raha hai.....wo kya mere se badi queen hai......
