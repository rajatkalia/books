Dellimna of 1st January Asylum Trial

Now if i am taken to the asylum for 6 Months and then relieved, that means that the world has been made by God and there is no step whatsoever and step like things are merely an illusion.

While if I stay in the asylum for say around 6 Years at a stretch this time, that means that the world has been made by me and there is step and pain and no healty solution to any querry but merely hardwork and no or low pay in return. Further it would mean that STEP is a real thing and not illusion.
