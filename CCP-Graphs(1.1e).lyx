Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The First Edition was a collection of tough problems but the file was small
 , only being 12 pages not meeting the Amazon crieteria of minimum 24 pages
 for paperback printing.
 Moreover, the toughness of problems required that answers be provided Intext.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphs is a very catchy topic for +1/+2 level and Competitive Exams, it
 is apparent that books in this particular topic would be written and available
 soon in the near future.

 On a displacement-time graph, two straight lines make angles of 30° and

{ Hint: The velocity in a displacement-time is given by the slope of the
 curve.

{ Hint: The displacement in a velocity-time graph is given by the area under
 the graph with proper signs.
 From 0s - to 2s , the area is 8m .
 From 2s - to 4s , the area is -4m .
 From 4s - to 8s , the area is 8m.
 Adding these 3 values , we get 8m + (-4m) + 8m = 12m.
 } The distance in a v-t graph is given by the absolute area under the graph.
 So, taking the absolute values of individual area divisions, we get 8m
 + 4m + 8m =20m

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
{ Hint: Depending on the question requirements, we'll have to check all
 the assertions one by one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
a) In a position time graph, the slope gives velocity.
 It can be clearly seen that Graph B has a much lower slope than Graph A
 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 So, the assertion is wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
b,c) By drawing a line parallel to the line A which is a tangent to Graph
 B , it can be seen where the two graphs have same slope.
 It is clear that the graphs have same slope between 0 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{B}$
\end_inset

 as noted from the figure.
 So, assertion b is wrong while c is correct.

\begin_layout Quote
d) As the Graph A has a constant slope, so the acceleration of body A is
 zero.
 Whereas Graph B is constantly turning, so the slope can be assumed to be
 non-zero throughout.
 According to some revelations, however it is noted that the figure is not
 clear enough to show whether Graph B is straight after 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{B}$
\end_inset

 or bending.
 In case it is assumed to be straight, then after 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{B}$
\end_inset

 both trains will have same (zero) acceleration.
 Also at start both have large (infinite) accelration, in which case the
 ratio of the two large ( infinite ) values may be calculated if initial
 conditions are mentioned and is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
At our level we would assume this assertion to be wrong, however making
 a note that the image should have been more clearly presented.

{ Hint : While both are in air, the differece of their velocity vectors
 would be a constant vector , so

 Also, after the first stone hits ground, 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle x=c_{2}t-x_{o}$

 There is no discontinutiy.
