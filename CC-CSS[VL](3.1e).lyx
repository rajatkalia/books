\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we are going to take a closer look at what is behind the
 demand curve and the behavior of consumers.
 How does a consumer decide to spend his/her income on the many different
 things that he/she wants, i.e., food, clothing, housing, entertainment? We
 assume that the goal of the consumer is to maximize his/her level of satisfacti
on or joy, constrained by his/her income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Economists use the term utility as a measure of satisfaction, joy, or happiness.
 How much satisfaction does a person gain from eating a pizza or watching
 a movie? Measuring utility is based solely on the preferences of the individual
 and has nothing to do with the price of the good.
 Let’s do an experiment in utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 01: Get some of your favorite candy, pastries, or cookies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 02: Take a bite and evaluate, on a scale from 0 to 100 (with 100 being
 the greatest utility), the level of utility from that bite.
 Record the marginal utility of that bite (i.e., how much you get from that
 one additional bite).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 03: Repeat step 02.
 It is important to be consistent with each unit consumed, i.e., the same
 size and no drinking milk or water part way though.
 When you run out of candy or your marginal utility goes to zero you can
 stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The law of diminishing marginal utility states that as more of the good
 is consumed, the additional satisfaction from another bite will eventually
 decline.
 The marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from each additional bite.
 As more of the good is consumed, we gain less additional satisfaction from
 consuming another unit.
 Thus even if a good were free and you could consume as much as you wanted,
 there would be a limit to the amount you would consume due to the law of
 diminishing marginal utility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summing the marginal utilities gives us the total utility.
 For example, let’s say the first chocolate was an 85 and the second chocolate
 had a marginal utility of 79, then the total utility from consuming two
 chocolates is 164.
 The total utility from consuming three chocolates is 85+79+73 = 237.
 As long as our marginal utility is positive our total utility increases
 although with diminishing marginal utility it increases at a decreasing
 rate.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can marginal utility be negative? Yes.
 At a holiday dinner, you may overeat and suffer from indigestion afterwards
 to a point where you regret having eaten too much, but at the time of the
 dinner, you expected greater utility from eating the last of the meal.
 We would not willingly consume an item that gave us negative marginal utility.
 Then why would an individual stuff themselves during a hot dog eating contest
 where clearly the last hot dogs consumed are making them worse off? Although
 the marginal utility from the last hot dog itself makes the person worse
 off, the utility from winning the contest is greater making the marginal
 utility positive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marginal utility of an item can change.
 For example, during a drought water provides a high positive marginal utility,
 and with more rain the marginal utility declines.
 At some point, there is too much rain, it turns from being a good utility
 to a bad one and the marginal utility of more rain, when it is already
 flooding, is negative.

\begin_layout Subsection
Maximizing Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Utility values can be determined by an individual ranking his/her preferences
 from least preferred to most preferred.
 The resulting ranking or utility values are subjective or individual.
 They are also ordinal rather than cardinal.
 Ordinal means that the utility values simply define a ranking of preferences
 rather than an actual cardinal measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine a class has 10 students in the class and the teacher lined the students
 up according to height.
 He then numbered them off according to height, assigning the shortest student
 a 1 and the tallest student a 10.
 Is it true that student number 4 is twice tall as student number 2? Of
 course not.
 All we know from the ranking is that student number 4 is taller than student
 number 2.
 Now, imagine that in another class another teacher has also ranked 10 students
 according to height.
 Is it true that student number 10 from the second classroom is taller than
 student 1 from the first classroom? We cannot say since the ranking is
 only valid within a particular course.
 In order to say a student is twice as tall as another student or to be
 able to compare students between classes, we would need a cardinal measure
 of height like inches or centimeters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since utility is ordinal and not cardinal we cannot make interpersonal compariso
ns of utility.
 Does a rich person value a dollar more or less than a poor person? While
 some would say that a poor person likely has more unmet needs and thus
 he would value the dollar more.
 The answer is that it all depends on the preferences of the individuals.
 A poor person may prefer to live a more simplistic life and place a lower
 value on having an extra dollar than a rich person who has a “love of money”
 (1 Timothy 6:10).
 We simply cannot make such an interpersonal comparison of utility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how does the consumer decide what to purchase? Unfortunately everything
 has a price and consumers only have so much money to spend.
 Consequently consumers try to spend the limited money they have on what
 will give them the greatest amount of satisfaction.
 The decision rule for utility maximization is to purchase those items that
 give the greatest marginal utility per dollar and are affordable or within
 the budget.
 Many grocery stores provide a tag that indicates the price per pound for
 the good.
 This allows consumers to compare the cost per pound for different brands
 or different sizes.
 The same concept is used for maximizing utility but we divide the marginal
 utility by the price to get the marginal utility per dollar.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let’s say that we eat only two goods: milk shakes and pizza where the price
 of each slice of pizza is $2 and the price of each shake is $1 and we only
 have $11 to spend.
 Since the price of each good is different we need to divide the marginal
 utility by the price to allow for a common comparison.
 We then compare the marginal utility per dollar for pizzas verses shakes.
 For the first unit the marginal utility per dollar of a shake is 50 compared
 to only 45 for the pizza, so we would purchase the first shake.
 We then compare the marginal utility per dollar of the first pizza (45)
 to the marginal utility per dollar of the second shake (40) and purchase
 the first slice of pizza.
 If the marginal utility per dollar is the same for the two goods and we
 have income to purchase both then we would do so, as seen in the second
 slice of pizza and the second shake.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We continue to allocate on budget on those goods that yield the highest
 marginal utility per dollar.
 In this example, we would purchase four slices or pizza and three milkshakes
 and spend our entire budget of $11.
 The total utility from this purchase would be the sum of the marginal utilities
: 50 + 90 + 80 + 40 + 70 + 60 + 30 = 420.
 At the last items purchased the marginal utility per dollar spent on the
 two goods is the same, no other combination of pizzas and milk shakes will
 give us greater utility given our budget.

Practice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is your chance to practice.
 Holly has $20 to spend on either movies or bowling and wants to maximize
 her utility.
 Complete the table and determine how many movies and rounds of bowling
 will maximize her utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Images/CC/CSS/3e/ImagesResized/5-1_Consumer_Behavior_10.jpg
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first step is to divide the marginal utility of each item by the price.
 With an income of $20 she is limited in what she can purchase.
 Since the marginal utility per dollar for bowling (15) is greater than
 the marginal utility of the first movie (12.5) she would initially go bowling,
 spending $4.
 Comparing the first movie (12.5) to the second round of bowling (10) she
 would go to the movie spending an additional $8 and a total of $12.
 The decision is a little harder.
 Holly has eight dollars still to spend and the marginal utility per dollar
 is the same for each good.
 If she chooses the movie she will spend all eight dollars, but if she goes
 bowling she will spend four dollars and still have four to spend.
 We have assumed that she wants to spend all her money and gains no utility
 from holding the cash.
 Since she can’t afford to buy another movie but would instead by a third
 round of bowling, which only has a marginal utility per dollar of 7.5.
 Thus we see that to maximize her utility, she would purchase one round
 of bowling and two movies giving her a total utility of (60 + 100 + 80)
 = 240.
 Recall our decision rule is to have the marginal utility per dollar spent
 on the last items be the same for all goods.
 In this case, we are unable to have that exactly but we try to get as close
 as possible.
 There is no other combination that would give us greater utility given
 our income.

Deriving Demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing how the consumer behaves allows us to derive a demand curve.
 Let’s say that Suzette eats either an apple or an orange as a snack.
 She has $12 to spend.
 Given that each fruit costs two dollars, she will maximize her utility
 by purchasing 3 apples and 3 oranges.
 If we are looking at the demand for oranges, this will give us one point
 on the demand curve.
 At a price of $2.00, the quantity demanded of oranges is 3.
 
\end_layout

	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that as we move along the demand curve, the only thing that changes
 is the price of the good (ceteris paribus or holding all else constant).
 If the price of oranges decreases to $1, the quantity of oranges demanded
 increases to 6.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can plot the two points and create a demand curve for oranges.
 At a price of $2 the quantity demanded is 3 and at a price of $1 the quantity
 demanded is 6.
 Recall that the demand curve reflects the marginal benefit or the willingness
 to pay of the consumer.

\begin_layout Standard
The demand curve can be seen in the diamond-water paradox.
 Why does water that is essential to sustain life cost so much less than
 diamonds that are atheistically pleasing, but are relatively unnecessary?
 Recall that price reflects the scarcity of a good.
 Overall, the supply of water is relatively abundant while the supply of
 diamonds is relatively limited.
 Thus the price we pay for water is low compared to the price of diamonds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it logical for someone who is maximizing his utility to purchase both
 water and diamonds? When deciding what to purchase we compare the marginal
 utility divided by the price.
 With lots of water consumption, the total utility of water is very large
 but the marginal utility of the last gallon consumed is relatively low.
 Few diamonds are purchased so while the marginal utility is very large,
 say the diamond ring you just purchased for your future spouse, the total
 utility is low since few diamonds are purchased.

How Businesses React
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing that individuals experience diminishing marginal utility, how do
 businesses react? Recall that consumer surplus is the area below the demand
 curve but above the price.
 Think of some examples of how businesses react given the law of diminishing
 marginal utility.

One example is the price per unit based on package size.
 An ice cream store has three different serving sizes - a 6, 10, and 12
 ounce cup.
 The price of the smallest size, "Like It," is $4.29 or 71.5 cents per ounce.
 For just 32 cents more, one can have four more ounces, "Love It," making
 the marginal cost per ounce 8 cents and the average cost per ounce 46 cents.
 Upgrading to the "Gotta Have It" size adds an additional two ounces with
 only 15.5 cents per ounce more and an average cost per ounce of only 41
 cents.
 Certainly the large size is cheaper per ounce, but not everyone wants to
 eat that large of a serving.
 For those only wanting a small serving, the store takes advantage of their
 greater willingness to pay for that portion size.
 Whether its ice cream, eggs, milk, popcorn, or cereal, it is common practice
 to charge a higher price per unit for a smaller package size.
 However it pays for consumers to do the math since businesses will at times
 charge a higher price on the larger packages size.
 If customers believe that bigger is always cheaper and fail to do the math,
 they may get caught paying a higher price per unit.

Consider this example.
 You are on a long airplane ride, seated next to an eccentric looking woman
 and a businessman.
 Halfway into the flight, the woman says to you and the businessman, that
 she is very rich and bored of flying.
 To break up the monotony, she offers you and the businessman a chance to
 split $5,000.
 The rules are as follows: the businessman makes an offer of how to split
 the money and you either accept or reject.
 If you accept, you get the agreed upon split.
 If you don’t, you both get nothing.
 This is a one time offer.
 The businessman thinks and offers the following split $4,995 for him and
 $5 for you.
 Do you accept or reject the offer? Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer to these questions will vary among individuals.
 Some will accept stating they have five dollars more than they did before.
 Others will reject the offer, saying that it is worth at least five dollars
 to them to deny they businessman the $4,995.
 Remember that when we talk about utility, it includes not only monetary
 items but also the nonmonetary.

In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith wrote: "How selfish soever
 man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature
 which interest him in the fortune of others and render their happiness

 of seeing it.” Remember that utility is derived from many different areas
 including service and philanthropic acts.

Indifference Curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indifference curves and budget constraints allow for a more in-depth analysis
 of demand.
 For modeling purposes we will look at the two goods.
 An indifference curve shows the different combinations of the two goods
 that yield the same level of utility, independent of the price of the goods.
 Due to the law of diminishing marginal utility, the indifference curve
 between the two goods is convex to the origin.
 All combinations of the two goods (pizza and shakes) that are on the indifferen
ce curve (A, B, and C) yield the same level of utility, say Utility = 100.
 Having more of good, yields a higher level of utility (combination D) and
 having less of the goods yields a lower level of utility (combination E).

An indifference curve map shows the family of indifference curves.
 There could be an infinite number of indifference curves that would reflect

 Just as a line on a topographical map indicates the different points that
 are at the same elevation, the different points along an indifference curve,
 indicate that same level of utility.

Marginal Rate of Substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marginal rate of substitution is the slope of the curve and measures
 the rate at which the consumer would be willing to give up one good for
 the other while maintaining the same level of utility.
 Thus the marginal rate of substitution reflects the ratio of marginal utilities
 between the two goods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, at point A, the consumer would be willing to trade one shake
 for one additional slice of pizza.
 At point B, the consumer already has a lot of pizza but few shakes so the
 marginal utility from an additional pizza is relatively lower and the marginal
 utility from the shake he would have to give up would be relatively large,
 thus to maintain the same level of utility he would have to gain 3 pizzas
 to willingly give up one half a shake.

Budget Constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The budget constraint indicates the combinations of the two goods that can
 be purchased given the consumer’s income and prices of the two goods.
 The intercept points of the budget constraint are computing by dividing
 the income by the price of the good.
 For example, if the consumer had $8 to spend and the price of pizza was
 $2 and shakes were $1, then the consumer could buy four pizzas ($8/$2)
 or eight shakes ($8/$1).
 Any combination of the two goods that are on or beneath the budget constraint
 are affordable, while those to the outside (farther from the origin) are
 unaffordable.

\begin_layout Standard
A greater income will cause a parallel shift rightward of the budget constraint
 while a decrease in income will cause a parallel shift leftward.

\begin_layout Standard
Changing the prices of the goods changes the slope of the budget constraint.
 If the consumer’s income is $8 and the price of pizza is $2 and the price
 of shakes is $1, then the budget constraint would be BC1.
 If the price of pizza drops to $1, then the budget constraint would rotate
 out on the x-axis to BC2.
 Alternatively, if the price of shakes increased to two dollars then the
 budget constraint would become BC3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slope of the budget constraint is the negative ratio of the prices (-Px/Py).
 For example, given the price of pizza (on the x-axis) is $2 and the price
 of shakes (on the y-axis) is $1, then the slope of the budget constraint
 would be -2.

Utlity Maximization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the goal of consumers is to maximize utility given their budget constraint
s, they seek that combination of goods that allows them to reach the highest
 indifference curve given their budget constraint.
 This occurs where the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint
 (combination A).
 Note that combinations B and C cost the same amount as A; however, A is
 on a higher indifference curve.
 Combination D yields that same utility as C and B but doesn’t use all of
 the income, thus the consumer can increase utility by consuming more.
 Combination E is preferred to combination A, but is unattainable given
 the budget constraint.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We previously mentioned that utility is maximized where the marginal utility
 per dollar spent is the same for each of the goods.
 At the point where the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint,
 the slope of the indifference curve which is the ratio of marginal utilities
 (-MUx/Muy) is equal to the slope of the budget constraint (- Price x /
 Price y).
 This equation can be rewritten to show that the marginal utility per dollar
 spent will be the same for both goods.

\begin_layout Standard
The demand curve can be derived from the indifference curves and budget
 constraints by changing the price of the good.
 For example, if the price of pizza is $4, the quantity demanded of pizza
 is two.
 If the price of pizza decreases, the budget constraint becomes flatter
 and the consumer can purchase more pizza, say the price of pizza drops
 to $2 and consumer purchases 4 units.
 If the price drops to $1.33, the quantity demanded increases to 5.
 Plotting each of the price and quantity demanded points creates the demand
 curve for pizza.

Income and Substitution Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When discussing why the demand curve is downward sloping, we outlined the
 substitution effect and income effect.
 We can observe the changes in quantity demanded along the demand curve
 due to the change in price; however, the indifference curves and budget
 constraints can help us analyze the size of the income and substitution
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, say the consumers income is $15 and the price of apples is
 $1 and the price of oranges is $3.
 At these prices the consumer purchases six apples and three oranges.
 When the price of oranges falls to $1, the consumer purchases eight apples
 and seven oranges.
 Thus on the demand curve for oranges, the consumer purchases three oranges
 when the price is three dollars and seven oranges when the price is one
 dollar.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bringing the new budget constraint back to the original indifference curve
 allows us to break down the income and substitution effects.
 Since the slope of the budget constraint reflects the ratio of prices,
 the substitution effect is the increase in the number of oranges that would
 be purchased given the new prices, while staying on the original indifference
 curve that is moving from point A to point B.
 The movement from point B to point C is the income effect, the additional
 consumption of oranges due to the increased purchasing power.
 With a decrease in the price of oranges, the relative price of apples has
 increased and fewer apples would be consumed due to the substitution effect;
 however, due to increased purchasing power, more apples are purchased as
 well as more oranges.

Recall from our elasticity discussion that the income elasticity for an
 inferior good is negative.
 For example, as income rises the demand for used clothing decreases.
 Looking at second-hand clothing on the x-axis, as the price declines the
 substitution will be positive (movement from point A to point B); however,
 the income effect (movement from B to C) will be negative.

\begin_layout Subsection
Extreme Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When examining indifference curves and budget constraints, we can look at
 a few extremes.
 One extreme case would be if the two goods are perfect complements.
 For example, you do not get additional satisfaction from having another
 right shoe, unless you have a left shoe to go with it.
 In the case of perfect complements, you always consume at the minimum combinati
on of the two goods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another extreme is perfect substitutes.
 You purchase paper in either the 100 or 200 sheet packs and only value
 the number of sheets.
 You are indifferent between having two one-hundred sheet packages or one
 two-hundred sheet package.
 In the case of perfect substitutes, there are three different outcomes
 that will maximize utility.
 If the price of one package, yields a lower per sheet cost, the consumer
 will buy only that good, so consumption will take place at one of the two
 intercepts.
 The third outcome is when the budget constraint has the same slope as the
 indifference curve.
 In this case, any combination along the budget constraint will yield the
 same level of utility.

Government Food Stamps Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why does the government give welfare recipients food stamps instead of cash?
 Why are food stamps sold on the black market for a discount? Let’s assume
 a person has $75 of income and receives $75 of food stamps from the government.
 For simplicity, we will assume that the price of each unit of food and
 the price of clothing are each one dollar.
 The budget constraint allows the consumer to purchase up to 150 units of
 food, but since food stamps can only be used to purchase food, the consumer
 is limited to only being able to purchase 75 units of other items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount of food and other goods, the individual will purchase depends
 on the shape of his indifference curve.
 Provided that the person spends at least 75 dollars on food, he is not
 constrained by receiving food stamps instead of cash.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, for those individuals with strong addictions, such as cigarettes
 or alcohol, their indifference curves reflect the greater value received
 from the addict substance.
 Since food stamps only apply to purchasing food, the consumer is not able
 to get as much utility and is restricted to point A.
 If the food stamps had been in the form of cash, the consumer would have
 purchased 40 units of food and 110 units of alcohol, point B, which would
 yield a higher level of utility.

\begin_layout Standard
If the consumer could convert a portion of the food stamps to cash, even
 at a discount, he would be able to reach a higher indifference curve.
 Assume that he can trade food stamps on the black market for 50 cents on
 the dollar which extends his budget constraint increasing the amount of
 alcohol that can be purchased.
 Selling food stamps at a discount allows the consumer to move to point
 C, which yields a higher utility than point A.

We can also model why individuals purchase items today and carry the debt
 on their credit cards paying a high interest rate.
 For example, let’s say the price of each good is $1.
 Assume Will has $100 of income which he could spend today or invest the
 money and receive $150 in the future.
 By waiting, Will would have a greater purchasing power, but his consumption
 bundle will depend on his preferences.
 If he has a strong preference for having consumption today, he would be
 willing to pay a higher price for those goods today.
 The same is true for those who buy items on credit.
 They are willing to pay the purchase price plus all the interest, so that
 they can have it today (so the indifference curve touches the budget constraint
 at a point closer to the x-axis as seen in the figure).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, some individuals are willing to pay to go to the expensive theaters
 to see a movie when it is first released.
 Others will wait until it comes to the cheap theaters or even until it
 comes out on DVD/Blu-ray.
 Although individuals are paying for the “movie experience” and not just
 the film itself, we can see the time preferences of individuals and the
 price differentials over time (as represented by different placements of
 the indifference curves).

\begin_layout Section
Supply and Demand Curves ( Understanding Price and Quantity in the Marketplace
 )
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do parents – and stores – behave this way? The answer is in the laws
 of supply and demand.
 Together, these laws give us strong clues about what to produce, how much
 to produce, and how much to charge.
 Because supply and demand play such a central role in our economy, it's
 important to understand how they operate – and how you can use them to
 analyze decisions about price and quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Law of Demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demand, in economic terms, shows how much of a product consumers are willing
 to purchase, at different price points, during a certain time period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After all, we all have limited resources, and we all have to decide what
 we're willing and able to purchase – and at what price.
 As an example, let's look at a simple model of the demand for a good –
 let's say, gasoline.
 (Note that this example is illustrative only, and not a description of
 the real gasoline market.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the price of gas is $2.00 per liter, people may be willing and able to
 purchase 50 liters per week, on average.
 If the price drops to $1.75 per liter, they may be able to buy 60 liters.
 At $1.50 per liter, they may be prepared to purchase 75 liters.
 Note that while some gas usage is essential – driving to work, for example
 – some use is optional.
 Therefore, as gas prices drop, people may choose to make more optional
 trips during weekends, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting demand schedule for gas might look like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This schedule, and probably your own experience as a consumer, illustrates
 the law of demand: as price falls, the corresponding quantity demanded
 tends to increase.
 Since price is an obstacle, the higher the price of a product, the less
 it is demanded.
 When the price is reduced, demand increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, there is an "inverse" relationship between price and quantity demanded.
 When you graph the relationship, you get a downward-sloping line, like
 the one shown in figure 1, below:

 and combined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Price Elasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extent to which demand changes with price is known as "price elasticity
 of demand."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inelastic products tend to be those that people must have, but they use
 only a fixed quantity of it.
 Electricity is an example: if power companies lower the price of electricity,
 consumers may be happy, but they probably won't use a lot more power in
 their homes, because they don't need much more than they already use.
 However, demand for luxury goods, such as restaurant meals, is extremely
 elastic – consumers quickly choose to stop going to restaurants if prices
 go up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Price elasticity also affects supply.
 Products with an inelastic supply usually have a long lead time, with little
 control over the quantity produced.
 Farm crops are one example, because if there's a price change, farmers
 can't decide halfway through the growing season to produce more or less
 of a certain crop.
 On the other hand, products with a high elasticity of supply tend to come
 from industries that can change their production levels more quickly –
 for example, oil (although the oil industry may be operating close to full
 capacity, right now.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Law of Supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While demand explains the consumer side of purchasing decisions, supply
 relates to the producer's desire to make a profit.
 A supply schedule shows the amount of product that suppliers are willing
 and able to produce and make available to the market, at specific price
 points, during a certain time period.
 In short, it shows us the quantities that suppliers are willing to offer
 at various prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This happens because suppliers tend to have different costs of production.
 At a low price, only the most efficient producers can make a profit, so
 only they produce.
 At a high price, even high cost producers can make a profit, so everyone
 produces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using our gasoline example, we find that oil companies are willing and able
 to supply certain amounts of gas at certain prices, as seen below.
 (Note: we've assumed a simple economy in which gas companies sell directly
 to consumers.)

At a low price of $1.20 per liter, suppliers are willing to provide only
 50 liters per consumer per week.
 If consumers are willing to pay $2.15 per liter, suppliers will provide
 120 liters per week.
 The question is this: what prices are needed to convince producers to offer
 various quantities of a product or service?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As price rises, the quantity supplied rises as well.
 As price falls, so does supply.
 This is a "direct" relationship, and the supply curve has an upward slope.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because suppliers want to provide their products at high prices, and consumers
 want to purchase the products at low prices, how is the price of goods
 actually set? Let's go back to our gas example.
 If oil companies try to sell their gas at $2.15 per liter, do you think
 they'll sell as much? Probably not.
 Yet, if oil companies lower the price to $1.20 per liter, consumers will
 be very happy, but will there be enough profit? And furthermore, will there
 be enough supply to meet the higher demand by consumers? No, and no again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the price and quantity of goods in the market, we need to find
 the price point where consumer demand equals the amount that suppliers
 are willing to supply.
 This is called the market "equilibrium."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Equilibrium: Where Supply Meets Demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equilibrium is the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity
 supplied.
 This means that there's no surplus of goods and no shortage of goods.
 A shortage occurs when demand is greater than supply – in other words,
 when the price is too low.
 A surplus occurs when the price is too high, and therefore consumers don't
 want to buy the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The great thing about the free market system is that prices and quantities
 tend to move toward equilibrium and, for the most part, keep the market
 stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider our example.
 At $1.20 per liter, consumer demand exceeds supply, and there's a shortage
 of gas in the market.
 Shortages tend to drive up the price, because consumers compete to purchase
 the product.
 However, when prices go up too much, demand decreases, even though the
 supply may be available.
 Consumers may start to purchase substitute products, or they simply may
 not purchase anything.
 This creates a surplus.
 To eliminate the surplus, the price goes down and consumers start buying
 again.
 In this manner, equilibrium is usually maintained quite efficiently.

 However, it doesn't explain changes in total demand and total supply.

\begin_layout Subsection
Changes in Demand and Supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A change in price initially results in a movement along a demand or supply
 curve, and it leads to a change in the quantity demanded or supplied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what happens when there's a long-term change in price?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If consumers are faced with an extreme change in the price of gas, their
 pattern of demand for gas changes.
 They not only start choosing different types of transportation – like taking
 the bus or riding a bicycle to work – but they also start buying more gas-effic
ient vehicles – like compact cars, motorcycles, or scooters.
 The effect is a major change in total demand and a major shift in the demand
 curve.
 The new schedule for demand is now Demand 2, shown below.

The same type of shift can occur with supply.
 If the price of drilling for and refining gas increases, or if political
 events cause suppliers to decrease their output, the supply curve can move.
 The result is that for the same price, the quantity supplied will be either
 higher or lower than the current supply curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common complaint with the oil and gas industry is that suppliers deliberately
 manipulate price by shifting the supply curve.
 The result is an equilibrium price that's higher and at a lower quantity,

Key Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the phrase "supply and demand" is commonly used, it's not always
 understood in proper economic terms.
 The price and quantity of goods and services in the marketplace are largely
 determined by (a) consumer demand and (b) the amount that suppliers are
 willing to supply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demand and supply can be graphed as curves – and the two curves meet at
 the equilibrium price and quantity.
 The market tends to naturally move toward this equilibrium – and when total
 demand and total supply shift, the equilibrium moves accordingly.
 It's an interesting relationship that determines much of what happens in
 a free market economy.
 If you understand how these factors influence pricing, supply, and purchasing
 decisions, it will help you analyze the market and make better price and
 supply decisions for your company.

Apply This to Your Life
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider these questions in relation to your life and business:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are your production costs higher or lower than those of your competitors?
 What does this mean for your business if supply or demand curves shift?
 Are you charging as much as you could for your product, particularly if
 demand is strong and supply is weak? Conversely, are you charging too much?
 Are you paying too much for your inputs, particularly if demand for these
 inputs is weakening? If demand for your inputs is likely to strengthen,
 or supply weaken, in the future, how can you protect yourself against this?
 Are there any other questions you should be asking yourself as a result
 of knowing about supply and demand curves, equilibria, and shifts in supply
 and demand curves?

 However her other PC via HCL didn't have original windows.
 Apart from it my Macbook Air had orgininal Operating system too.
 It appears that as a system rule, if somebody uses a pirated software,
 it's normalized price needs to be paid to the software owners during system
 audit.
 So, with lots of people using Microsoft Office, Photoshop etc softwares
 would be audited when a System Audit Cheque is accepted anywhere into the
 System.
 And people don't fear being audited too, they say we are not afraid to
 pay the price as it would be lesser than what it is on the web if we buy
 the original one under the agreement.
 And mind you , Bill Gates is born rich due to the Microsoft Office Licences

 Later it became a base for the Aam aadmi party as it's very brilliant members
 like Ashutosh leaving reporting and goint to join the National Theme Party.
 I don't know if the present day team of Aaj tak has any links with Aam
 Aadmi Party or not.
 Usually the channels with political bias lose their spirit in small run,
 even in this special case when the party has emerged of this channel to
 some extent.
 News channels like ABP when they first came on TV, they were fast but it
 was clear that they were party supportive with ABP supporting congress
 and also defending it.
 Though at one time it became my favourite News channel but i don't think
 it deserves a mention here do to the issues of unclean nutrality.

 Later however many pakistanis cross to india in an attempt to find cleaner

 It's an old statement.
 I would instead start with let's say , what's a blackhole or a quasar or
 a pulsar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you are in +1/+2 so mostly you know about gravitation , current , pressure
 etc.
 So, in a blackhole, let's see at the centre first, one possibility is that
 there's extreme pressure, temprature gravitation and current.
 Second possibility is that above the centre the forces balance out, like
 in case of sun, it's being said that even though above it's extremely hot
 with plasma and neuclear fusion reactions going on , in the inside it is
 not so and there are people out there trying to scientifically prove it.
 There are sci-fi movies like the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The Core
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 which say that earths centre is also the same as sun and there is no hot
 core and it's a primitive civilization living inside the earth, however
 in case of earth, these claims have been widely rejected, maybe possible
 in case of somewhere else in the universe's earth, i mean some other earth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what is a blackhole.
 Is it something to be inquisitive of.
 Is it something to be afraid of?? Or is it the solution to all our problems.
 And why am i interested in blackhole and how can i help in learning about
 it.

 there are other two types of monkeys}

So , due to my disease which is a form of Paranoid Scizophrenia , i can

 Don't worry I am not a dangerous person who can spy on you, I take medicine
 now.
 These things which i am showing here are what I saw before taking medicine
 and now i have faint memory of them.
 Gandhiji claimed that every person in the world is one of these three types
 of monkeys and has one of these special gifts which connects them to God
 and after 35 years of age everybody has old age protection from god's side.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what exactly the use of these blackholes , quasars and pulsar's etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They can create heavier elements than our normal 118 elements .
 But then why don't we find these elements created by blackholes anywhere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I will tell what I have seen , then later I'll tell the fantasy.
 Blackholes are the excretion points of the universe where they consume
 worn out planets and stars and exit them out of this universe by feeding
 them to the other end of the opening of other universes about to be created
 .
 Now a question arises, if this much mass was teleported out of the universe,
 where does the universe balance it's mass from.
 The answer is again what I can see , the universe boundries have a shell
 like covering made of faint white and black salt which creates life and
 matter.
 from there the material enters , from blackholes it exits.
 But then we know of the nutron burst which created the universe? Don't
 blackholes consume all mass and all planets and stars and grow big to become
 the neutron star? and then it bursts again to create the univese again
 .
 The answer is , yes this is one alternate mechanism.
 I told our universe's mechanism and you are telling the one connected to
 yours.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Million dollar question? What happens to US when these blackholes consume
 everything.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there is a 2 Rupee answer (provided free of cost or covered in the price
 of this book).
 We have already moved to alternate universes and blackholes consume only
 completely dead planets and solar systems.
 So when the universe is completely dead , then the neutron star is formed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another irritation in brain.
 What is a universe according to hindu religion? It's the body of bhagwan
 in spirtual domain.
 Like we have a body, now we are on the outside , we can't take care or
 look inside , so we are the devil who is greater being then god.
 Under our skin , there is a force always looking inwards and providing
 all the necessary things to all cells who are inside and taking care of
 them .
 Now we see these cells on operation or a cut in physical domain , but if
 we close our eyes and look inside we can see a similar univese to ours
 from a position outside it , near our head , our eyes.
 So universe is nothing but a person's body, inwardly controlled by God
 and not that person, however that person is the one who provides food and
 takes work out of the body.
 Interstingly what we see outside is also another universe with all the
 people and we are a small being in this universe while that inner universe
 is so cool we are even bigger than it.
 So what are we? we are at the boundary.
 Why we see both differently is because , like we say that the universe
 has all the planets and solar system and so frightning things and inside
 our body there are the cells the tissues and the brain , heart etc frightening
 things.
 Why do we see them different, This is because we are seeing the outside
 planets and solar systems etc in the spiritual domain , similarly in our
 body we can look in spiritual domain by closing our eyes and looking inwards.
 While the cells and tissues and organs etc are in Physical domain .
 Our universe also has it's physical domain similar to us and we tried to
 visualize the blackhole as an excretory organ.
 There is another domain, the mechanical domain one of the three domains
 which i have seen and it has all the medicine reservoirs in our body and
 we simply refill them or change the medicine already present in our bodies
 in these reservoirs.
 There can be other domains in auditory and speech sections, I myself haven't
 seen them how they work, but i hope there would be atleast 3 domains there
 too in each method.

 stories or other intersting stories.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Fruits and vegetables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now there is an intersting story going, and I have seen it with my eyes
 as well.
 10000 years punishment in a blackhole.
 It occours when someone becomes a vegetable or a fruit.
 Now everyday the birth begins , there is very faint light inside the blackhole.
 We can move slightly in the room , the blade starts and we are cut completely
 and then we die.
 Then we wake up and again have a fresh body and it's again cut and then
 we are left to die, it's repeated 84 lakh times in a total time span of
 10000 years.
 This punishment starts when 84 lakh vegetables or fruits are consumed by
 one person.
 Interstingly a chicken on the other hand has relatively much more freedom
 than this case .
 So, a chicken consuming person can be in much better state than this person,
 however traditional hindu religion says not to consume non-veg.
 Possibly the removal of shell of the vegetable , and offering the first
 piece to god etc are possible escape routes from this punishment, while
 Guru Nanak Dev ji says

The universe is only a small part of the world without much significance.
 Now if the complete logic of everything fails, then say a billion universe
 group fails, in that case the error recovery runs.
 I have seen this happeing in my vision (Live) , I know the pain too as
 it happened to me too and also saw the difference in magnitude of pain
 in blackhole, quasar, pulsar etc.
 Blackhole is amongst the easiest as an enemy punishes there.
 In a pulsar , you keep thinking all the time that it's your father who
 is running it.
 All are extremely painfull.

\begin_layout Standard
Now these three visions, the scenario is seen at the beginning and starts,
 later what happens is very intersting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In one tiger and 999 tigresses, the tiger is able to save durga and takes
 her away.
 He is Man ( the inner heart ) and durga is probably saved in this scenario.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2nd 8 billion tigers and tigresses, all of the tigers and tigresses are
 born out of durga's womb with an explosion and she gets red clothing due
 to the blood which came out along with the birth and due to the explosion
 it spreads on her body.
 In this scenario , durga is later killed by the tigers while some tigers
 try to save her too and fight for righteousness.
 There is an invisible tiger too in this case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Kali one , she looks like priyanka chopra.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there is a 13 member family , where one boy is born at the 7th place
 and he has a sister.
 He kills the sister with her own nail and she later becomes godess and
 creates the world with one tiger .
 Now in that case none of the 13 family members experienced any physical
 pain and the brother who had killed the girl and tiger later gets left
 alone and with one word Aum he sets into meditation and he is one person
 in that world and takes all births of humans and animals etc all alone.
 Now there was a very massive operation which took place when that guy killed
 the girl and the tiger and implanted them in his body.
 It was a perfect operation.
 That guy is dil and there is a floor also where he meditated and that was
 also dil.
 ( It's the heart in hindi ).
 Had that person sinned or not is not known but he is the normal living
 thing we see ourselves and around us.
 Moreover this girl looks a bit clever in the vision and probably knew or
 was pretending that she was not getting harmed in the operation (atleast
 that's what appears from the facial expressions which I saw.).
 Aah I remember, before finally setting into meditiation, he bent his body
 into shapes thinking that the tiger's body shape was different than his
 and he bent his body into 8400000 shapes too(Or probably 8.4 , i.e.
 8 or 9 shapes, or best just 8 shapes for ease.).
 So, for example if he bent his body like a mosquito , the mosquito he made
 would be as big as a human.
 The girl's name was Suman Radaa ( similar sounding to modern day Radha
 ) , boy's name was Rahul .

\begin_layout Section*
The bible's begining of the world
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In one of the most popular version's of bible , it is said that the earth
 was already present in the beginning, it had matter and water , these two
 components and probably no air .
 Then the holy spirit ( probably god ) roamed near it in space and with
 one command all the living beings were created.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I want to tell what happened in the delta time that command was being
 spoken, we know that before it no living being was there and after it all
 the living beings came to existance.
 Now lets see what happened in that small time.
 Now before that time the matter looks completely calm and dark and water
 was also calm and only spilt when the holy spirit passed by ( sort of primitive
 ocean waves ) .
 The matter was clear in it's mind that it is the strongest and it can't
 be beaten, while the water looks extremely happy and enjoyed even more
 when holy spirit came near and sort of played with it.
 In the place of contact of water and matter, there was some sort of contact
 which was not a matter of conflict between matter and water till the holy
 spirit came to picture.
 Now when the command was spoken, water was the first to get frightened
 and it immediately realised that it's not a single entity and composed
 of smaller particles and they tried to come near each other in a state
 of fear created by the command and disturbances were set in water.
 As the intensity of shrill of the shriek kept on increasing, the disturbances
 further increased and vapour was created.
 Matter was still like a single entity and it was feeling like a pain in
 head ( it's body ) due to the sudden noice and wanted to reply back but
 didn't have a tongue or face for that matter.
 It started withering near the contact , not due to water causing itching
 but because the noice was so painfull to it.
 Later we know that now earth has a hot core and an atmosphere and probably
 formed in the beginning itself .
 All the living things were created after the peak of the delta was reached
 ( similar to birth case ) and slightly after the peak noice .
 All living beings were created, now where did the holy spirit go, it was
 also a human in the plane where lots of other humans were standing and
 he brought out a mic from his pocket and made the first announcement and
 explained the key things to everyone just born.
 Now he was completely mad while everyone else just born was partially mad.
 It's not known what happened to him afterwards but then we know of the
 Adam and eve story and see that he was still present or maybe some of his
 descendents or he himself.
 Then probably Christ was the last in their lineage and now there further
 cults like illuminati claiming that marovengians in france is a group of
 people who have christ's descendents and lineage, and many movies like
 Da Vinci Code showing the legend.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now here , from physics point of view , what's important is that matter
 is present, water is separate from matter and then all the charge is concentrat
ed in one supernatural being , the holy spirit .
 Now every human has a soul which is small chage with shiny black colour
 or blue color matter in the interior.
 So we see that Physics mostly is dealing in the Spiritual domain of the
 world and not physical or mechanical domain as much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Criticism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now this is a partially mad man's view , i.e.
 me .
 I can se souls and male souls have mostly black condensed liquid in the
 interior , probably a mixture of matter and water for completeness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However , drug addicts on the other hand think that this cant be the case
 with them.
 They say that their soul is completely white , they say that matter and
 liquid combination can be created as a grass mixture too and can be fed
 inside the charge outer shell of the soul.
 Now interestingly I have myself seen souls which are dense white and are
 very big in size ( 3 to 4 cm dia compared to usual 2mm dia(meter) ) .
 They look like a spherical egg.
 There are other smaller completely white souls too ( with 2.5 cm dia kindaa
 ) , now i don't know whose souls these are in all but some people have
 really peculiar souls.
 It's possible that I am consuming excessive amount of coca cola coke and
 it's visible in my soul.
 In other people's case it can be some other substance they are consuming

Now, we know of Hydrogen.
 What's it like ? does it smell good or bad ? (Well actually hydrogen has
 a punchy smell, you can buy uncle chips and it is packed in Nitrogen getting
 punchy odour due to the chips and the masala) We know it can be used as
 fuel for state of the art combustion cells, and is seen as a modern alternative
 to petroleum.
 We know fusion bombs ( also some are hydrogen bombs ) work on this principle
 , that a neuclear reaction hydrogen atoms combine to form Helium and produce
 lots of energy.
 Hitler's Archeotype which was a baloon like aeroplane having hydrogen caught
 fire and all people inside died (America was an enemy though but also the
 technology was flawed too).
 Modern cars and space shuttles might benifit from it.

Now hydrogen done.
 Do we discuss all elements or few of them as we are not a chemistry course.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmmm.
 Hydrogen has importance to physics.
 Then which other elements .
 Let's see .
 Ummm...
 let have a brief look at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Helium, it's the product of a fusion reaction, and an inert gas.
 Used by scuba divers when mixed with oxygen in some particular ratio, it
 has upper hand to nitrogen due to non formation of compounds with blood
 under large pressure.

Boron, a nuclear product and having nuclear active isotopes too.
 Having intersting reactions in chemistry salt analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
Carbon, Now this deserves some space.
 Your complete organic chemistry is compounds of carbon.
 Human body has mostly organic compounds as it's living.
 Then we gift diamonds , they are pure carbon.
 What else, we have the carbon contact points in the dc generator motor
 etc.
 We have charcoal , a type of slightly impure carbon used as the bed in
 chemistry salt analysis.
 We have lots of electrical equipments using carbon parts , batteries and
 all, even cells and high voltage ones too have large percentage of carbon
 present.
 Hmmm.
 Is that all, we see that all things which are black are not carbon.
 So we couldn't find as many uses of carbon as it appeared , a blackhole
 is not made of carbon , it can have probably very little percentage of
 it.
 But the human organs are all carbon based organic compounds made .
 We see that Carbon has ample applications in Organic chemistry and biology
 but not as much in Physics but still it can have say few usefull applications
 we can say.
 Mostly coz we talk electricity , we need metals, we talk machines we need
 metals, we talk say civil engineering , we have asphalt there , a carbon
 compound and oil's last residue but otherwise civil engineering has dams
 and large constructions and carbon can have small applications somewhere
 or the other in it but not a massively important material .
 Actually why i am speaking a bit anti is coz since childhood i have been
 told that it's extremely important material and now that i am trying to
 write a paragraph , i find not so many uses to be able to write a good
 paragraph.
 But the atomic number 6 and mass number 12 can say something.
 But then these are human relation talk and not physics talk.
 Let's stay in physics domain only and the judgement is , it's another normal
 element like the rest of the elements, not too useless , not too usefull.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nitrogen, It's odourless .
 Air is odourless and has large percentage of Nitrogen.
 It is used by plants and nitrogenous manures are considered extremely good
 for crops.
 Nitrogen fixing bacteria fix them for plants.
 And I have already said we have nitrogen packaging of food too.
 In a sci-fi movie terminator 2 , the enemy gets nearly killed by the accident
 with a liquid nitrogen tank and few minutes later gets completely killed
 too due to some other reason.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oxygen, the massively important material for breathing widely portrayed
 in sci-fi that people in mars and the rebillion there are getting lesser
 of it.
 Mostly kept and extracted for artificial respiration systems.
 Oxides are a trouble as they are to be broken back to get the pure element
 and the pure element sometimes comes in contact with air and forms oxide
 again.
 No special use as far as physics is concerned.
 If we spell it as Oak-season then it refers to the dirtiest enemy in the
 Mythology movies.
 And they keep on attacking in their season.
 Now clean air is devtas according to some people( according to me too as
 i have seen them ) and bhagwan is foul air ( clean air which has gathered
 some foul and is smelling bad now ) , now what is oxygen it remains to
 be questioned as it's a part of both clean and foul air .

Sodium, now Natrium (Na) .
 Kept in kerosene so that it doesn't catch fire in air.
 In water if it's kept it burns beautifully .
 A component of caustic soda and baking powder.
 23 it's atomic mass and 11 it's atomic number.
 Sodna means a very bad term in punjabi sexual terminology.
 It's intersting that the english terminology has chosen the name sodium
 and not Natrium completely ignoring the punjabi meaning.
 As far as physics is concerned , in present times we don't see much use
 except compounds of it can be usefull.
 Direct Sodium we don't use much except state of art projects i think.

Phosphorus, 15 atomic number.
 In this particular subastance , we can say we know one natural application.
 We see bodies burning in shamshan ghat in night due to the phosphorus in

Sulphur, 16 atomic number.
 Sulphur dioxide has fart like pungent smell.
 Sulphur is supposed to be present in alien clothes which sci-fi movies

 Then sulphur is a component of tubeless tyres etc.
 Also present in some chemicals.
 Match stick's burning masala's component etc are few of it's uses.

Chlorine, 17 atomic number but less reactive than fluorine in group 17 elements.
 Common Salt is abundant in nature and can be used to create chlorine using
 electrolysis.
 Detective television series show that it could be used in killings back
 in 1940's and then it used to be to be very hard to trap them due to weak
 medical technology for ascertianing the cause of death, however these days
 it's not used for killing as medical science has grown strong.

Jamadar - The person who knows just addition, or is new in the clan.
 Although meant for the low education people, this word is used as a slang
 for the people doing punitive work as cleaners of toilet , floor managers
 etc implying that Punit Duggal was low in Education.
 Similarly Umesh Duggal also did Engineering from a lowly college from reservati
on from his quota for diploma holders and now their sister has gone totally
 unsensitive towards the failed courses and they do not matter any more
 to her even when she probably began the degree in 2012 probably.
 Duggal himself had a job somehow although he didn't look educated.

 mathematics naturally and keep experimenting coolly with it are Devil's
 children.
 Basically it would be extremely uneconomical for a computer to do one or

Matka(With a master's degree) or People doing higher studies than encountered

 or Ye Cobi Han .
 Or this is a copy.(or these are Cobras) Although I have already said in
 RN's excerpt in my resume , that it's possible that these extreme knowledge
 tools have some use for God.
 But not for normal humans who can't feel or interpret these tools physically
 as to what they mean.
 But definitly they can be very useful at God's level when whole of the
 knowledge is required for him.
 But there can be pitfalls for us like the Maxwell theory which has been
 classified completely rubbish by me so far as it cannot be verified, but
 it seems later in life I prove it's some part as right, the way they are
 presently given in books is wrong probably.
 Though Maxwell's tools those 4 equations if physically interpretted as
 waves can be very useful in understanding physics, but maybe I'm wrong
 and those equations don't mean anything .
 But I remember something of previous births and probably did some matlab
 work to prove those equations right for my own use.
 But I have already failed the course in IIT, proving that what was taught
 in the course was wrong.
 So, really lots of work pending for me to do in life, proving maxwell's
 equations and interpretting them physically for my own use.
 Probably someone explained the meaning of Maxwell's equations to me from
 my own book in previous births, that's why I was able to fly then and not
 now in this birth.
 But most of the times I flied in Previous births, I had to exit the body
 immediately afterwards in most cases, simply making it more safe to learn
 such a knowledge just before death or when one's term as a being is about
 to end and not before that so that one starts flying and loses his cool
 about the fact that anyone should not fly without proper protection or
 it can be dangerous.

\begin_layout Subsection
What's it like in the flight experience?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One low lying jet of air comes, and you can adjust your hand to ride on
 it, it's similar to swimming except the fact that it's much easier than
 swimming as you don't have to apply any thrust but simply fly with the
 jet's thrust.
 But if the jet somehow ends in mid air, you simply fall without getting
 hurt, but there can be crash landings in case you don't land properly .
 If however some obstacle comes, it's not to be worried of as the jet would
 find another passage and not end in the obstacle, and we are simply riding
 the jet already present in air instead of creating our own jet(the way
 aeroplanes fly).
 The only problem is that you probably need to understand the aerodynamics
 of it using Maxwell's equations and interpret them physically before it
 actually works.
 And believe me , all objects are living, so my underwear would learn from
 seeing me fly and it would be able to fly on itself and can carry a human
 with it later too.
 While some people like amit might say that they already fly as birds, but
 we say it's in a bird's birth not human birth with human unabridged body.

\begin_layout Standard
It's not M.Tech.
 It's limiting case of Masters audited by God probably and you should pass
 it at death only with the honours going on after restart.
 It involves some extreme arts like being able to fly coz u have studied
 it, being able to swim because your feet can touch the bottom of any deep
 reservoir as one ligament is broken , being able to slide down any wall
 coz your wrist bone is broken.
 Amongst these only flying is something to be spoken of highly others are
 merely luck related.
 So, God would be probably a PHD if he is higher than us.
