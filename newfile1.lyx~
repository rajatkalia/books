\begin_layout Chapter*
Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relativity we can see in movies in few paradoxes, a person can come back
 to where he was and see himself working there alongside him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then we have kind of time machines , transponder has a separate book for
 itself and now this separate book on General Relativity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why rajat kalia didn't teach much relativity to students in his lifetime
 is coz he expects his student to be completely verse in the subject because
 otherwise he/she won't be able to understand what's being taught.
 Relativity is one of the most expert topics and requires great versatility
 in physics subject itself before a student deserves to learn it from rajat
 kalia ji.
 However he made radio broadcast many times of complete relativity in greatest
 details totally unimaginable to our level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Favourite comments include one student Shashank(divya-later neha kalia[Kaur
 B/Anupam Kher] with SC Certificate) claiming that some particles can move
 faster than light .
 Probably he meant that in his visions he has seen some people moving faster
 than the speed of light.
 Probably he got inspired by the movie scenes in movies like star trek where
 you see wonderfull application of a transponder.
 I think for performing that kind of scene you need to read that book.
 It's avaliable freely in web resources or you can even buy a copy if you
 want to be the actor in that movie.
 It's a previous book written in Rajat Kalia's living time and well recieved
 with a Quake III transponder picture on it's cover.
 We won't be disucssing transponder at all in this book and look into crude
 numerical problems just to limit vague imagination and stay in actual limits
 of physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tell you why transponder is not relativity, answer is just check the name
 of that transponder book to know what it really is.
 Here my job is to teach relativity , but there's this constant projector
 bug problem that some arses are demanding to teach transponder.
 I mean there's already a book on it why should i teach it here, the mechanism
 is written in thayt book.
 Then there would be that photo's indian and foreign actors having sex with
 whom one can perform that stunt in the movie, that person would have actual
 trasponder unlike the indian actor.
 Then see the name on the book on whose name that book is that is the actual
 person in rajat kalia's family who is the owner of transponder

If transponder photo was put(by Rajat Kalia) on any other book of Rajat
 Kalia(his own book) also , then check it's details as well to know who
 are the concerned people.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 That book has been written by Rajat Kalia so he's the actual owner without
 doubt.
 Then there would be few foreign actors who would be the thumbnail image
 here and indian actors who would be the enlarged image and mind you indian
 actor is a villain.
 Further i would like to assure once again that transponder is not relativity.
 Read that book's title name so that you can know what are the detailed
 mechanisms of Transponder.
 I tell the name

Ackcnowledgements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now if the transponder movie actors kindly excuse me on projector then i
 can start with relativity theory and problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason i'd like to repeat why Rajat Kalia din't teach it in class coz
 no student was verse in it.
 Otherwise Rajat Kalia would have taught to that student alone if there
 was such a student.
 Radio broadcast he had done many times in childhood and was for normal
 shrotagans.
 Arvind Chauhan teaches from Rajat Kalia's notes or the problems he solved
 while preparing for iit or while teaching.
 It's a useless argument that Arvind Chauhan tried to teach relativity to
 Rajat Kalia after reading from Rajat Kalia's documents coz that is already
 available in videos, whatever he could read from Rajat Kalia's documents
 and understand he has shown it in his lectures.
 And mind you they were 134 Actors.
 So if one single guy or few could teach relativity amongst them and has
 tought it's shown in channel 112 videos already.
 But then even if they mattered , they were only basics, we'd go much deeper
 and assure full returns.
 Further I am Xpinder Narula, Rajat Kalia's foreign actor and Indian hacked
 account actors are no worth to me at all.
 Now if the back house aunty pleads that she is the actual indian actor
 and not a hacked account one , I remind that in India your pigs were looming
 around Rajat Kalia to tell him that you are the actual Rajat Kalia and
 not him, that's why I am concerned.

High Speed Button in a Star War Rocket
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They are using warm holes technology only don't worry but it's appearing
 in stunt form that's why looking catchy FYI.
 In 5th or 6th movie Luke Skywalker shows Returned Jedi the fast speed button.
 Also the Rajat Kaliia robot tweaks in the rocket to start fast speed in
 anothor star wars movie.
 Evidently they din't use high speed or anything but only warm holes but
 with stunt technology which can be much superior to actual warmhole method
 used in normal movies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Relativity Theory Basic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reletivistic mechanics deals with motion of objects moving at speeds of
 the order of light where possibly the laws of classical mecanics can snap
 at some place or the other.
 So Relativistic mechanics is only mechanics theory but at very high speeds.
 Now another dumbshell Shekhar Dutt is asking on projector how could devtas
 travel the universes at even much higher speeds.
 My answer to that dumbo, that is in spiritual domain only, one can shift
 the soul from heart to liver with a piercing prick in 10 to 15 seconds
 .
 you can calculate the speed here, 1 feet in 15 seconds or roughly 2 inches/seco
nd and that's much lesser than the speed of light , however with all the
 drugs it can appear much larger than the speed of light to Shekhar Dutt.
 { I must repeat that soul is a spherical object with risnia outer coating
 solidified to like bullet proof glass density with technology and coke
 cocentrate inside It is put using an injection inside a person, some people
 can have more than 1 of them..
 However if a person is consuming Red Bull or other drink, soul would have
 that color concentrate inside }We are talking in Physical Domain and not
 in Spiritual Domain or mechanical domain where the constuction of universes
 is different.
 There are further three sound domains similar to these which Rajat Kalia
 didn't delve much in and mostly closed their workings so that unnessary
 loads on our SYSTEM doen't mount up.
 Probably they are handled by harappa and it appears as an additional feature
 in our SYSTEM.
 While they probably might be calling our features sound handling in their
 own language.
 So, let's not worry about those things.
 Further to spoil things further, Sonia Sood(Today's Manish Kalia) has stolen
 the lan cable and put a duplicate lan cable in it's place.
 He is saying that put on the wi-fi jacks even if you are connecting through
 lan to internet just like the amazon.com football goal copyright of ghoda.
 Now it's a question who goes for the talk and whether he heeds or not to
 the demand remains to be seen.
 If those arses(aarav soods) are succussfull then there would be an additional
 wi-fi device necessacity even if a person is connecting internet via lan
 .
 I think those talks would happen today.
 One of the arses(who is Kairav(Krishnan)) is encountring the problem that
 end of cycle audit is coming near and that can make him very very poor
 compared to what he is these days.
 We can only offer wishes/good health/good luck to him, don't worry kiddo,
 good time will come again without doubt, have faith in your uncle Rajat
 Kalia.

Here we'll stay fixed on relativistic speeds , i.e.
 speeds of the order of the speed of light.
 Or very high speeds.

Here we have two similar to river crossing question scenarios studied in
 Kinametics.
 Let's have a fast gothrough.

Now another Manish Kalia actor is trying to prove in relativity that lengths
 don't change.
 He has seen in Ramayan that Lakshman's wife returns to earth travelling
 in space and is much taller.
 So, i think this has made a kind of impression in his mind that space travel
 changes height/length of object.
 In that case i definitely assure that relativity is purely modern thing
 of computer age, not in spiritual domain sagas like ramayan which are not
 played in physical domain of the world but in reletively stripped down
 other kind of domain called the spiritual domain.
 Secondly lakshman's wife was already that height when she started the space
 travel .
 It was their relative hight difference that was in question.
 I tell the answer, all of you have seen baba balaknath, it was the response
 of that with girl higher height than man, not a height change due to space
 travel.
 Further you also might have seen pooja shaking drake videos also, so watch
 it, relativity is modern science, not dream stuff.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we fix a frame of reference to a 1-D rod and a second frame of reference
 a fixed point in space.
 Then we go with the like river travel question studied in kinematics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here our x-axis is along the rod and the y-axis is perpendicular to it
 going through that fixed point in space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
{Another stupid manish is asking why space why not a point on earth.
 My answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dumbo we are studying ideal case.
 We study physics for studing ideal case not for imaginary cases imagined
 by a dumbass pakoda.
 Studying ideal case takes a lifetime of learning, can't be learned in minutes.
 Do you know how much error case you are talking about by talking about
 an earth reference point.
 Evedently it can't be solved using physics and you would have to go to
 step coz you have written in your book that you are taking earth as reference.
 Evedently it would need earth's corriolis rotations then sun's galctic
 rotations into consideration and coz you have written it in pdf that you
 are calculating it it would amount to a step to make you forget that thing
 and work on new thing.
 The calculations you have shown are only ideal case which you might have
 studied or probably created, but this earth reference is a serious error
 and this is not physics mostly probably coz you din't learn the subject
 properly and Rajat Kalia has already written in his book what you are trying
 to do , watch the

\begin_layout Standard
So we have light moving from the rod to that fixed point (in space) and
 that object is translating towards that fixed point.
 Assume a light photon went from the rod to that fixed point ..We choose the
 origin at a point where the perpendicular from that point in space falls
 on the rod.
 That point becomes a pont on the y axis(say) and the rod is on the x-axis
 with our chosen origin.

\begin_layout Standard
Now we talk about the relativity concern in the y direction.
 We wan't a reletavistic frame of reference so let's assume that this whole
 stuff(our frame) is moving in some other frame(Frame 2) as well with a
 relativistic speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 parallel to y axis.
 Now from origin if a photon goes towards that fixed point according to
 Frame 2 it would move with 
\begin_inset Formula $c-v$
\end_inset

 going in positive y direction forward and 
\begin_inset Formula $c+v$
\end_inset

 while returning(as shown in the figure).
 So, it would take time 
\begin_inset Formula $\dfrac{2cy}{c^{2}-v^{2}}$
\end_inset

....(1) (similar to the first problem of irodov or boat upstream downstream
 travel questions done in 9th mathematics) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's look at the second case.
 Here we see that for a point x, the Frame 2 would have moved a distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $vt_{o}$
\end_inset

 forward if the photon from origin hit's a point x on x-axis in frame 1
 along the y direction(that point is P now.).
 Just like the river drift question we need to send the photon to slightly
 right so that it travels along x axis and then comes back.
 (By pythagoras law, in the velocity triangle diagram, just like the drift
 question in first irodov chapter.).
 You see i try to explain the things if it's difficult.
 The frame is moving with speed v along y axis so everything, even a light
 photon is getting dragged backword(towards -y) so we need to throw the
 photon at an angle so that it goes along x axis instead.
 got it??? So the photon's speed now is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}$
\end_inset

, you can see in the velocity triangle diagram.
 So the total travel time along x axis is 
\begin_inset Formula $\dfrac{2x_{o}}{\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}}$
\end_inset

....(2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we introduce a special constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 (beta) as the ratio of speed of the frame of reference to that of speed
 of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Review Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problem 1 : Now the fist problem of irodov, if you wan't the full question
 to be written i'd write it here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A rod moves lengthwise with a constant velocity v relative to the inertial
 reference frame K.
 At what value of v will the length of the rod in this frame be 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 = 0.5% less than its proper length? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have put this very question , just to assure that the question is correct
 but i've said in the above discussion that length doesn't change doesn't
 need to be proved..
 But here we have a question how much length changes.
 Here you might have got it till now that what he means is that how much
 length change is appearing to your eyes or vision, and not any acutal length
 change.
 Seeing is believing kind of stuff.
 Apply the 2nd formula to get the answer.
 I think if we start discussing this kind of questions here it can reduce
 the trp rating of the book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mass Concerns in Relativity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the 2nd formula assuming that we are working along x axis if your teacher
 is insisting to do so.
 Or else if you wan't to write a research paper make actual calculations
 working in x and y directions.
