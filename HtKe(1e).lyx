\begin_layout Standard
The velocity of motion can be determined from the slope of the displacement-time
 graph.
 The velocity of the car is 
\begin_inset Formula $\dfrac{60}{5}=12m/s$
\end_inset

 from t=0 to t=5s , it is zero (the car is at rest) from t=5s to t=10s and
 is (0-60)/(15-10) from t=10s to t=15s.
 The negative slope in the last 5 s indicates that the car is moving backwards.
 Note that the slope of the graph in each of the time intervals is a constant,
 showing that the car is in a uniform motion (constant velocity) in each
 interval.

Fig.
 For the uniform motion shown in Fig.
 (a), the displacement is given by velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 time = 4 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 15 = 60 .
 This is represented by the area of the rectangle under the graph.
 In fact, for any velocity-time graph, the displacement at a certain time
 can be calculated from the area under the graph.
 Following this rule, we can work out the displacement for an object in
 uniform acceleration or deceleration.
 For Fig.
 (b) , the displacement is
\begin_inset Formula $6\times15/2=45m$
\end_inset

 , while for Fig.
 (c), the displacement is 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times15/2=30m$

Fig.
 shows the velocity-time graph of an elevator moving upwards.
 The elevator is initially at rest on the ground floor.
 It accelerates from rest for 2.5 s, reaching a velocity of 1ms
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

, then it moves at this constant velocity for 5 s, and finally decelerates
 to rest in 2.5 s.

The acceleration of the elevator at each time interval can be deduced from
 the slope of the graph.
 In the first 2.5 s, the elevator accelerates at 1/2.5=0.4ms
\begin_inset Formula $^{-2}$
\end_inset

 .
 The acceleration is zero for the next 5 s, and in the last 5 s the elevator
 decelerates at(0-1)/(10-7.5)=-0.4ms
\begin_inset Formula $^{-2}$
\end_inset

 to rest (the negative slope indicates a deceleration).
 Note that for the whole trip, the elevator is going upwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total displacement can be calculated from the area under the graph.
 In this example, the total displacement of the elevator is the area of
 the trapezium under the graph, i.e., total displacement =(5+10)

\begin_layout Standard
Fig.
 An acceleration-time graph shows the accelerations of a moving object at
 different times.
 Fig.
 shows the acceleration-time graph constructed from the velocity-time graph
 in Fig.
 .
 It can be seen that during the first 2.5 s and the last 2.5 s, the elevator
 is moving with a constant acceleration and deceleration respectively, and
 in between it moves at a constant velocity (zero acceleration).

For a distance-time graph, the distance never decreases.
 When the object is stationary, the distance-time graph will be horizontal.
 The gradient of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed of the
 object.
 For straight line with positive gradient, it means that the object is travellin
g at uniform speed There is no straight line with negative gradient (as
 the distance never decreases) For curves, it means that the object is travellin
g at non-uniform speed

\begin_layout Standard
Since you are not allowed to use calculators, SAT II Physics places a heavy
 emphasis on qualitative problems.
 A common way of testing kinematics qualitatively is to present you with
 a graph plotting position vs.
 time, velocity vs.
 time, or acceleration vs.
 time and to ask you questions about the motion of the object represented
 by the graph.
 Because SAT II Physics is entirely made up of multiple-choice questions,
 you won’t need to know how to draw graphs; you’ll just have to interpret
 the data presented in them.
 Knowing how to read such graphs quickly and accurately will not only help
 you solve problems of this sort, it will also help you visualize the often-abst
ract realm of kinematic equations.
 In the examples that follow, we will examine the movement of an ant running
 back and forth along a line.

Position vs.
 time graphs give you an easy and obvious way of determining an object’s
 displacement at any given time, and a subtler way of determining that object’s
 velocity at any given time.
 Let’s put these concepts into practice by looking at the following graph
 charting the movements of our friendly ant.

\begin_layout Standard
Any point on this graph gives us the position of the ant at a particular
 moment in time.
 For instance, the point at (2,–2) tells us that, two seconds after it started
 moving, the ant was two centimeters to the left of its starting position,
 and the point at (3,1) tells us that, three seconds after it started moving,
 the ant is one centimeter to the right of its starting position.
 Let’s read what the graph can tell us about the ant’s movements.
 For the first two seconds, the ant is moving to the left.
 Then, in the next second, it reverses its direction and moves quickly to
 y = 1.
 The ant then stays still at y = 1 for three seconds before it turns left
 again and moves back to where it started.
 Note how concisely the graph displays all this information.
 Calculating Velocity We know the ant’s displacement, and we know how long
 it takes to move from place to place.
 Armed with this information, we should also be able to determine the ant’s
 velocity, since velocity measures the rate of change of displacement over
 time.
 If displacement is given here by the vector y, then the velocity of the
 ant is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $v=\dfrac{\triangle y}{\triangle t}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you recall, the slope of a graph is a measure of rise over run; that
 is, the amount of change in the y direction divided by the amount of change
 in the x direction.
 In our graph, is the change in the y direction and is the change in the
 x direction, so v is a measure of the slope of the graph.
 For any position vs.
 time graph, the velocity at time t is equal to the slope of the line at
 t.
 In a graph made up of straight lines, like the one above, we can easily
 calculate the slope at each point on the graph, and hence know the instantaneou
s velocity at any given time.
 We can tell that the ant has a velocity of zero from t = 3 to t = 6, because
 the slope of the line at these points is zero.
 We can also tell that the ant is cruising along at the fastest speed between
 t = 2 and t = 3, because the position vs.
 time graph is steepest between these points.
 Calculating the ant’s average velocity during this time interval is a simple
 matter of dividing rise by run, as we’ve learned in math class.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How about the average velocity between t = 0 and t = 3? It’s actually easier
 to sort this out with a graph in front of us, because it’s easy to see
 the displacement at t = 0 and t = 3, and so that we don’t confuse displacement
 and distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Average Speed 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the total displacement in the first three seconds is one centimeter
 to the right, the total distance traveled is two centimeters to the left,
 and then three centimeters to the right, for a grand total of five centimeters.
 Thus, the average speed is not the same as the average velocity of the
 ant.
 Once we’ve calculated the total distance traveled by the ant, though, calculati
ng its average speed is not difficult:

Curved Position vs.
 Time Graphs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is all well and good, but how do you calculate the velocity of a curved
 position vs.
 time graph? Well, the bad news is that you’d need calculus.
 The good news is that SAT II Physics doesn’t expect you to use calculus,
 so if you are given a curved position vs.
 time graph, you will only be asked qualitative questions and won’t be expected
 to make any calculations.
 A few points on the graph will probably be labeled, and you will have to
 identify which point has the greatest or least velocity.
 Remember, the point with the greatest slope has the greatest velocity,
 and the point with the least slope has the least velocity.
 The turning points of the graph, the tops of the “hills” and the bottoms
 of the “valleys” where the slope is zero, have zero velocity.

\begin_layout Standard
In this graph, for example, the velocity is zero at points A and C, greatest
 at point D, and smallest at point B.
 The velocity at point B is smallest because the slope at that point is
 negative.
 Because velocity is a vector quantity, the velocity at B would be a large
 negative number.
 However, the speed at B is greater even than the speed at D: speed is a
 scalar quantity, and so it is always positive.
 The slope at B is even steeper than at D, so the speed is greatest at B.
 Velocity vs.
 Time Graphs Velocity vs.
 time graphs are the most eloquent kind of graph we’ll be looking at here.
 They tell us very directly what the velocity of an object is at any given
 time, and they provide subtle means for determining both the position and
 acceleration of the same object over time.
 The “object” whose velocity is graphed below is our ever-industrious ant,
 a little later in the day.

We can learn two things about the ant’s velocity by a quick glance at the
 graph.
 First, we can tell exactly how fast it is going at any given time.
 For instance, we can see that, two seconds after it started to move, the
 ant is moving at 2 cm/s.
 Second, we can tell in which direction the ant is moving.
 From t = 0 to t = 4, the velocity is positive, meaning that the ant is
 moving to the right.
 From t = 4 to t = 7, the velocity is negative, meaning that the ant is
 moving to the left.
 Calculating Acceleration We can calculate acceleration on a velocity vs.
 time graph in the same way that we calculate velocity on a position vs.
 time graph.
 Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity vector, , which expresses
 itself as the slope of the velocity vs.
 time graph.
 For a velocity vs.
 time graph, the acceleration at time t is equal to the slope of the line
 at t.
 What is the acceleration of our ant at t = 2.5 and t = 4? Looking quickly
 at the graph, we see that the slope of the line at t = 2.5 is zero and hence
 the acceleration is likewise zero.
 The slope of the graph between t = 3 and t = 5 is constant, so we can calculate
 the acceleration at t = 4 by calculating the average acceleration between
 t = 3 and t = 5:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minus sign tells us that acceleration is in the leftward direction,
 since we’ve defined the y-coordinates in such a way that right is positive
 and left is negative.
 At t = 3, the ant is moving to the right at 2 cm/s, so a leftward acceleration
 means that the ant begins to slow down.
 Looking at the graph, we can see that the ant comes to a stop at t = 4,
 and then begins accelerating to the right.

\begin_layout Subsection
Calculating Displacement 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Velocity vs.
 time graphs can also tell us about an object’s displacement.
 Because velocity is a measure of displacement over time, we can infer that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
displacement = velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphically, this means that the displacement in a given time interval is
 equal to the area under the graph during that same time interval.
 If the graph is above the t-axis, then the positive displacement is the
 area between the graph and the t-axis.
 If the graph is below the t-axis, then the displacement is negative, and
 is the area between the graph and the t-axis.
 Let’s look at two examples to make this rule clearer.
 First, what is the ant’s displacement between t = 2 and t = 3? Because
 the velocity is constant during this time interval, the area between the
 graph and the t-axis is a rectangle of width 1 and height 2.

The displacement between t = 2 and t = 3 is the area of this rectangle,
 which is 2 cm/s.1s = 2 cm to the right.
 Next, consider the ant’s displacement between t = 3 and t = 5.
 This portion of the graph gives us two triangles, one above the t-axis
 and one below the t-axis.

Both triangles have an area of 1 /2(1 s)(2 cm/s) = 1 cm.
 However, the first triangle is above the t-axis, meaning that displacement
 is positive, and hence to the right, while the second triangle is below
 the t-axis, meaning that displacement is negative, and hence to the left.

 In this graph, the ant is accelerating at 1 m/s2 from t = 2 to t = 5 and
 is not accelerating between t = 6 and t = 7; that is, between t = 6 and
 t = 7 the ant’s velocity is constant.

Acceleration vs.
 time graphs tell us about an object’s velocity in the same way that velocity

 time graphs tell us about an object’s displacement.
 The change in velocity in a given time interval is equal to the area under

 Be careful: the area between the graph and the t-axis gives the change
 in velocity, not the final velocity or average velocity over a given time
 period.
 What is the ant’s change in velocity between t = 2 and t = 5? Because the
 acceleration is constant during this time interval, the area between the
 graph and the t-axis is a rectangle of height 1 and length 3.

The area of the shaded region, and consequently the change in velocity during
 this time interval, is 1 cm/s2 · 3 s = 3 cm/s to the right.
 This doesn’t mean that the velocity at t = 5 is 3 cm/s; it simply means
 that the velocity is 3 cm/s greater than it was at t = 2.
 Since we have not been given the velocity at t = 2, we can’t immediately
 say what the velocity is at t = 5.
 Summary of Rules for Reading Graphs You may have trouble recalling when
 to look for the slope and when to look for the area under the graph.
 Here are a couple handy rules of thumb: The slope on a given graph is equivalen
t to the quantity we get by dividing the y-axis by the x-axis.
 For instance, the y-axis of a position vs.
 time graph gives us displacement, and the x-axis gives us time.
 Displacement divided by time gives us velocity, which is what the slope
 of a position vs.
 time graph represents.
 The area under a given graph is equivalent to the quantity we get by multiplyin
g the x-axis and the y-axis.
 For instance, the y-axis of an acceleration vs.
 time graph gives us acceleration, and the x-axis gives us time.
 Acceleration multiplied by time gives us the change in velocity, which
 is what the area between the graph and the x-axis represents.
 We can summarize what we know about graphs in a table:

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : a.) The total distance traveled by the object is the sum of all the distances
 it traveled during the time interval.
 In the first two seconds it traveled 3 m.
 Then it traveled 0 m in the next two seconds.
 Then over the next five seconds, the object moved 5 m, then remained at
 rest.
 so the total distance is 3 + 5 = 8 m.
 The displacement of the object is simply the final position minus the initial
 position, or -2 - 0 = -2 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) Notice that each of these points is in the middle of a line segment on
 the graph.
 Because of this, the instantaneous velocity at these points is the same
 as the average velocity over the time intervals represented by each segment,
 so: v(t) = (xf - xi)/(tf - ti) v(1) = (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2 = 1.5 m/s v(3)
 = (3 - 3)/(4 - 2) = 0/2 = 0 m/s v(6) = (-2 - 3)/(9 - 4) = -5/5 = -1 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the formula (xf - xi)/(tf - ti) is the same as the slope formula
 for this graph.
 The velocity at any point on a position vs.
 time graph is simply the slope of the graph at that point.
 By this definition, we also know that the velocity of any position function
 is its derivative with respect to time.
 You can also go from a velocity function to a position function using integrati
on.
 Go to calculus notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) Average velocity is displacement divided by time.
 We found in part a that the object's displacement is -2 m, so: vavg = -2/10
 = -0.2 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Average speed is total distance divided be time, and we found in part a
 that the object's total distance traveled is 8 m.
 so: 8/10 = 0.8 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) We determined in part b that the object's velocity is represented by
 the slope of the line segment on the graph.
 Since the slope of this segment is constant, the object's velocity at t
 = 5 is constant.
 Since constant velocity means there is no acceleration, a = 0.

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the problem above, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First car's (red) distance at time t is found by finding the area of the
 trapezoid whose boundary is the t-axis, the red lines and the vertical
 line representing time at t seconds.
 This of course assumes t>15 (otherwise, we have negative distances, and
 the trapezoid only starts at t=15.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the distance (at time t)
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times13.5\left(t+t-15\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
= The distance of the second car (blue) is found by finding the area of
 the blue trapezoid, bounded by the blue lines, the t-axis and the vertical
 line.
 (And this one assumes t>20, for the same reasons as above.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the distance (at time t)
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times17\left(t+t-20\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distance when they meet is the same, so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\times13.5\times\left(2t-15\right)}$
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\times17\times\left(2t-20\right)$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time =19.643 s 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance=163.93 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dilemma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this solution gives us a dilemma.
 As mentioned above, the expressions we found for the area of the trapezoids
 required t to be more than 15 s and 20 s, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can confirm the blue car overtakes the red car before 20 seconds, by
 calculating the distances travelled at that time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After 20 seconds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Red car has travelled 0.5×(20+5)×13.5=168.75 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blue car has travelled 0.5×20×17=170 m The blue car has travelled further
 than the red car, so it means it has already overtaken the red car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back to the drawing board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, in fact, for this question we need to consider the area of the blue
 triangle, not the blue trapezoid.

\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle d=\frac{1}{2}\times13.5\left(t+t-15\right)}$

 base times height):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $distance{\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times t\times0.85\times t}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equating these gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.75(2t − 15) = 0.425t
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
t =12.14 s, t = 19.63 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first solution has no practical meaning, since t>15 for the expression
 to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we conclude the time taken for the blue car to overtake the red car is
 19.63 s and the distance travelled at that time is 163.7 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate we have found the correct answer, below is the graph of distance
 against time.
 Labelling of axes is very important in this work!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The red curve corresponds to the acceleration portion of the first race
 car.
 At t=15, or point C(15,101.25), the red car stops accelerating and continues
 at a constant speed (CA is no longer a curve, but a straight line).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blue curve corresponds to the second (blue) car.
 It doesn't accelerate as hard (its curve is below the red curve, indicating
 it covers less distance in the same time), but it accelerates for longer.
 At t=20, or point D (20,170), it stops accelerating and its graph is now
 a straight line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see the curves intersect at time t=19.63 s, or point A (19.63,163.7),
 as we found in the calculation above.
 This means they have covered the same distance (163.7 m) at that time, so
 that's when the blue car passes the red car.

 : (Hint : In this problem, you are asked to describe the motion of the
 car.
 Whenever you are asked to describe the motion of an object without worrying
 about the cause of that motion, you have a kinematics problem.
 This problem is different from most kinematics problems, however, in that
 you are not asked for a numerical description but rather to use words and
 graphs to describe how the car moves.)

(Queries : How did you know that x = 0 at t = 0? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You don’t! If you are given a velocity-time graph, you know the initial
 speed but not the initial location of the object.
 (Calculus students, remember v = dx/dt, and the derivative of a constant—your
 initial location—is zero.) I chose to call the location of the car at t
 = 0 the origin, but you could start your graph at any point.
 The shape of the graph, however, should look the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why can’t I treat the straight line from t1 to t3 in a single step? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any time velocity is above the t-axis, it has a positive value and so slope
 of the x-t graph is also positive.
 A positive slope means that the line or curve is in such a direction as
 to make between a 0 and a 900 angle above the +x axis.
 Any time velocity is below the t-axis, it has a negative value and so the
 slope of the x-t graph is also negative.
 A negative slope means that the line or curve is in such a direction as
 to make between a 0 and a 900 angle below the +x axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why doesn’t the line from t3 to t4 look more curved? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the velocity-time curve gets closer and closer to v = 0 (the t-axis),
 velocity’s value is getting smaller regardless of direction.
 As the value of v decreases, so does the slope of the x-t graph.
 A decreasing slope means that the slope gets smaller and smaller—the line
 gets becomes more horizontal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve from t3 to t4 on the x-t graph shown here doesn’t look very curved.
 This is because its slope goes from the same value as it ended with on
 the t2 to t3 curve to almost zero (a horizontal line) and so not a lot
 of change as I have drawn it.
 Any line you draw that curves down and to the right becoming more horizontal
 as it goes is fine.)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To go between a velocity-time graph and a displacement-time or acceleration-time
 graph, you need to understand how velocity, displacement and acceleration
 are related to each other.
 In other words, you need to use the definitions of velocity and acceleration:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = Δx/Δt In words, the value of velocity = the slope of the x-t graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a = Δv/Δt In words, the value of acceleration = the slope of the v-t graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: Graphing problems seem like they should be straightforward, and the
 equations that you need are only those given above.
 It is very, very common, however, to make mistakes on these problems because
 it feels like the graphs should be pictures of the motion and they are
 not.
 In order to avoid those mistakes, make a table based on the sentences above
 and then draw the graph from the table.

Understand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this problem, you are given the velocity-time graph for the motion of
 a car.
 By relating the value of velocity to the slope of the x-t graph (this is
 just the definition of velocity) you are able to draw the x-t graph correspondi
ng to this motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By relating the slope of the v-t graph to the value of acceleration (this
 is just the definition of acceleration) you are able to draw the a-t graph
 corresponding to this motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can describe the motion looking at any of the three graphs.
 From t = 0 to t1 : The car travels forward (+ direction) with a constant
 speed.
 There is no acceleration and the car moves away from its starting point
 at a constant rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t1 to t2 : The car slows to a stop at a constant rate.
 It is still moving forward, but the amount of distance it covers in each
 second is decreasing.
 Acceleration acts against the motion of the car, or in the negative direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t2 to t3 : The car reverses direction, moving faster and faster (at
 a constant acceleration) in the negative direction.
 Acceleration is acting with the motion of the car, so it is also in the
 negative direction.
 The amount of distance the car covers each second increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t3 to t4 : The car continues to move in the negative direction but
 at a decreasing speed.
 The rate at which the speed decreases is getting greater—the driver is
 braking harder as the car stops—and so acceleration increases.
 Acceleration is acting against the motion of the car, or in the positive
 direction.
 The car covers less and less distance each second.

We need to find the unknown time t (in seconds), when the police catch up

 We find this by comparing the distance travelled by each (it will be the

 under the v-t curve for the police car (the blue shaded area).

 : a.) Recall that the equation for velocity is v = x/t.
 If we solve this for x, we get x = vt.
 Notice that this is the same as the area of a rectangles whose sides are
 lengths v and t, so we can determine that the displacement is the area
 enclosed by the velocity vs.
 time graph.
 So, we will find the area of each section under the graph:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total distance traveled by the object is simply the sum of all these
 areas: 3 + 6 + 4.5 + 2 + 2 = 17.5 m The displacement is found in a similar
 fashion, except areas below the x-axis are considered negative: 3 + 6 +
 4.5 - 2 - 2 = 9.5 m Interestingly enough, the area enclosed by any function
 can be represented by a definite integral.
 For example, if this graph were defined as a function v(t), then the displaceme
nt would be the integral from 0 to 10 of v(t)dt, and the total distance
 traveled would be the integral from 0 to 10 of |v(t)|dt Go to calculus
 notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) The position of the object at a given point in time can be found in much
 the same way we found the displacement in part a, except this time we must
 also add in the initial value given.
 So: x(2) = 2 + 3 = 5 m x(4) = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 m x(7) = 2 + 3 + 6 + 4.5 =
 15.5 m x(10) = 2 + 3 + 6 + 4.5 - 2 - 2 = 11.5 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that this can also be done by adding the integral from 0 to t of
 v(t)dt to the initial value of 2.
 Go to calculus notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) Like velocity in part b of problem 22, the instantaneous acceleration
 at any point along one of the graph's line segments is the same as the
 average acceleration across that line segment.
 The formula for acceleration is aavg = Δv/Δt = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti), so:
 a(t) = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti) a(1) = (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2 = 1.5 m/s2 a(3)
 = (3 - 3)/(4 - 2) = 0/2 = 0 m/s2 a(6) = (-2 - 3)/(9 - 4) = -5/5 = -1 m/s2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to the relationship between velocity and position, the formula
 for acceleration is the same as the slope formula for a velocity vs.
 time graph.
 So, we can say that the slope of any velocity vs.
 time graph is its acceleration.
 Notice that this definition defines acceleration as the derivative of velocity.
 So, it is true that for any velocity function v(t), its derivative is an
 acceleration function a(t).
 Also, integration can be used to go from an acceleration function to a
 position function.
 Go to calculus notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) We know that the acceleration along each line segment of this velocity
 vs.
 time graph is equal to the slope of the line segment.
 We determined these slopes in part c, so the acceleration graph would look
 like:

This graph uses horizontal lines instead of points to represent that the
 acceleration is defined at that value at any point along that section.
 The open circles at the end of each line segment simply indicate that at
 those time values, acceleration is not defined at either value represented
 by the horizontal lines.
 At these points, acceleration is undefined because it changes instantaneously
 from one value to the next, which cannot be represented numerically.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A, B, D, and E are maintaining a state of motion (i.e., remaining

 Which object(s) is(are) accelerating? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object C is accelerating.
 An accelerating object has a changing velocity.
 Since the slope of a p-t graph equals the velocity, an accelerating object
 is represented by a changing slope.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects A and E.

None of these objects change direction.
 An object changes its direction if it changes from a + to a - velocity
 (or vice versa).
 This translates into a p-t graph with a + slope and then a - slope (or
 vice versa).

5.
 On average, which object is traveling fastest? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

6.
 On average, which moving object is traveling slowest?

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A and E are maintaining their state of motion.
 To maintain the state of motion is to keep a constant velocity (i.e., to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Each of the objects are moving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the objects are moving.
 If an object were not moving, then the v-t graph would be a horizontal

 Which object(s) change(s) its direction? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects B and C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects B and C change their direction.
 An object that is changing its direction is changing from a + to a - velocity.
 Thus, the line on a v-t graph will pass from the + to the - region of the
 graph.
 Object D is not changing its direction; object D first moves in the - direction
 with increasing speed and then maintains a constant speed.

12.
 Which accelerating object has the smallest acceleration? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object B has the smallest acceleration.
 Acceleration is indicated by the slope of the line.
 The object with the smallest acceleration is the object with the smallest

\begin_layout Standard
Object A has the greatest velocity (and object E is a "close second").
 The velocity is indicated by how far above or how far below the axis the

 Object A has a large + velocity.
 Object E has a large (but not as large) - velocity.

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed
 in the positive direction is shown below.
 To have "a constant speed in the positive direction" is to have a + velocity
 which is unchanging.
 Thus, the line on the graph will be in the + region of the graph (above
 0).
 Since the velocity is unchanging, the line is horizontal.
 Since the slope of a line on a v-t graph is the object's acceleration,
 a horizontal line (zero slope) on a v-t graph is characteristic of a motion
 with zeo acceleration (constant velocity).

 An object which is moving in the + direction and speeding up (slow to fast)

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a slow,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a slow,
 constant speed in the + direction, and then with a fast constant speed
 in the + direction is shown below.
 Since there are two parts of this object's motion, there will be two distinct
 parts on the graph.
 Each part is in the + region of the v-t graph (above 0) since the velocity
 is +.
 Each part is horizontal since the velocity during each part is constant
 (constant velocity means zero acceleration which means zero slope).
 The second part of the graph will be higher since the velocity is greater
 during the second part of the motion.

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a fast,
 constant speed in the + direction, and then with a slow constant speed
 in the + direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a fast,
 constant speed in the + direction, and then with a slow constant speed
 in the + direction is shown below.
 Since there are two parts of this object's motion, there will be two distinct
 parts on the graph.
 Each part is in the + region of the v-t graph (above 0) since the velocity
 is +.
 Each part is horizontal since the velocity during each part is constant
 (constant velocity means zero acceleration which means zero slope).
 The first part of the graph will be higher since the velocity is greater
 during the first part of the motion.

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a constant

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a constant
 speed in the + direction, and then moves with a positive acceleration is
 shown below.
 Since there are two parts of this object's motion, there will be two distinct
 parts on the graph.
 Each part is in the + region of the v-t graph (above 0) since the velocity
 is +.
 The slope of the first part is zero since constant velocity means zero
 acceleration and zero acceleration is represented by a horizontal line
 on a v-t graph (slope = acceleration for v-t graphs).
 The second part of the graph is an upward sloping line since the object
 has + acceleration (again, the slope = acceleration for v-t graphs)

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : a.) Remember from problem 22 that velocity is the slope of a position
 vs.
 time graph such as this.
 By looking at lines tangent to the curve, we can see which point has the
 highest and lowest slope:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the red tangent lines, we can immediately eliminate point B as
 a candidate for both the maximum and minimum velocity, as its tangent is
 horizontal and thus has a slope of 0.
 Point C is the only marked point whose tangent line has a negative slope,
 so point C has the lowest velocity.
 Looking at points A and D, point A's tangent line has a steeper positive
 slope so point A has the highest velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) We know that acceleration is a change in velocity, so by asking whether
 acceleration is positive or negative, we are asking if the velocity is
 increasing or decreasing.
 Since velocity is the slope of this graph, we must determine how the slope
 of the curve is changing between points A and B.
 Looking at the diagram in part a, we see that the slope at point A is positive,
 and the slope at point B is 0.
 As such, the slope, and thus the velocity, must be decreasing.
 Therefore, the object's acceleration is negative in this interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) We know from problem 22 that velocity is the derivative of position,
 and from problem 23 that acceleration is the derivative of velocity.
 So, we will begin by differentiating the position function twice: x(t)
 = t3 - 9.5t2 + 23t - 9 v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 a(t) = 6t - 19
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we know the velocity and acceleration functions, all that is left
 is to plug the values of t into these functions and simplify: v(1) = 3
 * 12 - 19 * 1 + 23 = 3 - 19 + 23 = 7 m/s v(3) = 3 * 32 - 19 * 3 + 23 =
 27 - 57 + 23 = -7 m/s v(5) = 3 * 52 - 19 * 5 + 23 = 75 - 95 + 23 = 3 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a(1) = 6 * 1 - 19 = 6 - 19 = -13 m/s2 a(3) = 6 * 3 - 19 = 18 - 19 = -1 m/s2
 a(5) = 6 * 5 - 19 = 30 - 19 = 11 m/s2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) Thinking logically about the graph, the possible candidates for maximum
 and minimum position are at the end points of the interval and at the spots,
 like point B, where the slope of the graph is 0.
 So, first we set the velocity function from part c equal to 0 and solve
 for t: v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 = 0 t = 1.63008 s or t = 4.70326 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this was solved using a graphing calculator.
 The AP exam will not ask you to solve a quadratic this complicated by hand,
 however you may have to solve a simpler function using the quadratic formula.
 Also, we keep as many decimal places as we can at this stage in order to
 maintain accuracy.
 Now that we know all the possible times at which the position could be
 at a maximum or minimum within the interval, we simply plug these t values
 into x(t).
 Don't forget to check the end points: x(t) = t3 - 9.5t2 + 23t - 9 x(1) =
 5.5 m x(1.63008) = 7.58 m x(4.70326) = -6.93 m x(6) = 3 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the minimum position is -6.93 m, and the maximum position is
 7.58 m.
 Finding the maximum and minimum velocities is achieved in the same manner,
 except we set the acceleration function equal to 0 and plug the t values
 into the velocity funtion: a(t) = 6t - 19 = 0 6t = 19 t = 19/6 = 3.16667
 s

The area under the velocity graph is the displacement, which was given to

 Breaking the area under graph into a rectangle and a triangle yields 120
 m = v0 3 t + 1 2 Dv 3 t = 2 s 3 v0 + 1 2 20 m/s 3 2 s.
 (2) One can easily solve this for the initial velocity of the object, thus
 obtaining the answer to the problem (50 m/s is a quite unrealistic initial
 velocity for a thrown ball).
 No explicit use of the standard kinematic equations is made; the solution
 is based on only the graphs.
 The above problem is relatively simple; to see the real power of the method
 requires a more difficult 1-D kinematics problem.

 : Determined to test gravity, a student walks off the cN Tower in Toronto,
 which is 553 m high, and falls freely.
 His initial velocity is zero.
 The rocketeer arrives at the roof of the building 5 seconds later to save
 the student.
 The rocketeer leaves the roof with an initial velocity downward and then
 is in freefall.
 in order both to catch the student and to prevent injury to him, the rocketeer
 should catch the student at a sufficiently great height and arrive at the
 ground with zero velocity.
 The upward acceleration that accomplishes this is provided by the rocketeer’s
 jet pack, which he turns on just as he catches the student; before then
 the student is in freefall.
 To prevent discomfort to the student, the magnitude of the acceleration
 is limited to five times gravity.
 How high above the ground must the rocketeer catch the student?

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : As I was grading the assignment, one student’s solution stuck out.
 When I first saw it, I was convinced that something must be wrong as the
 problem had been difficult for me and could not be that simple.
 I was wrong.
 The simple solution consists of sketching the velocity and acceleration
 graphs for the falling student (Fig.
 2; down is taken as the positive direction) and using a bit of reasoning.
 Since the overall change in the student’s velocity during his motion is
 zero, the total area under the acceleration-versus-time graph must equal
 zero.
 This area consists of a positive part (above the time axis) and a negative
 part (below the time axis).
 The two rectangular areas must have equal magnitude, and since their heights
 differ by a factor of 5, so must their widths (the two corresponding times).
 Therefore, the freefall time is five times longer than the time for slow-down
 to rest.
 Now, looking at the velocity graph, the area labeled 1 corresponds to the
 displacement while in freefall, and the area labeled 2 represents the displacem
ent after the Rocketeer has caught the student.
 The triangles forming areas 1 and 2 have the same height, and the base
 (time) for area 1 is five times the base (time) for area 2.
 Therefore, area 1 must be five times larger than area 2.
 This means that area 2 must be 1/6 the total height of the building, or
 92.2 m.

After studying this solution for a long time and finding no flaws in the
 physics, I pulled out my physics book and tried solving other one-dimensional
 kinematics problems in a similar manner.
 It quickly became obvious that they could be done using graphs, and in
 most cases this is the easier method.
 I was hooked and began teaching one-dimensional problem solving this way
 in all my classes.
 The next class period I asked the student whose solution this was why he
 chose to do the problem this way.
 He explained that we had emphasized graphs so much in class that they must
 be more useful than something we are simply supposed to sketch for the
 problems.
 I was amazed and appreciative as I now had a new way to teach problem solving.
 This kind of solution is more visual and helps get students away from hunting
 for the “correct equation.” It has worked well for me at all levels of introduct
ory physics, conceptual through calculus based.
 If you find other interesting problems that are especially suited to the
 above method, I would appreciate your sharing them.

\begin_inset Formula $h_{o}-1/2gt^{2}$
\end_inset

, so eliminating t, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $h=h_{o}-v^{2}/2g$
\end_inset

.
 So, 
\begin_inset Formula $v=-\sqrt{2g(h_{o}-h)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Case 2: We assume the opposite for solving purpose that the ball is now
 thrown from a height 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{o}/2$
\end_inset

 and replace ho only and see the effect.
 Taking upward velocity as positive , we get 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\sqrt{2g(h_{o}/2-h)}$
\end_inset

Projection on Inclined Plane
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an inclined plane, we shift the co-ordinate axis x along the plane and
 y perpendicular to it.This is not necessary, but convenient usually.
 However, there are cases when it's usefull to treat a projectile on a inclined
 plane as a normal projectile of the above two cases.
