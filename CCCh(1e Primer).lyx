\begin_layout Section
The law of definite proportions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The law of definite proportions, also known law of definite composition,
 states that regardless of the amount, a pure compound always contains the
 same elements in the same proportions by mass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although many experimenters had long assumed the truth of the principle
 in general, the French chemist Joseph-Louis Proust first accumulated conclusive
 evidence for it in a series of researches on the composition of many substances
, especially the oxides of iron (1797).
 Another French chemist, Claude Berthollet, who held for indefinite proportions,
 contested Proust’s findings, but the Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson confirmed
 some of them.
 Proust had definitely proved “metals are not capable of indefinite degrees
 of oxidation.” The principle was then concretely formulated by the English
 chemist John Dalton in his chemical atomic theory (1808).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Examples of the Law of Definite Proportions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us take, for example, the compound water.
 Whatever the source of water, its composition is that of two atoms of hydrogen
 and one atom of oxygen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Law of Definite Proportions: % by Weight of Hydrogen and Oxygen in Water
 This figure shows that water, from any source, is always made up of two
 atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
 If we calculate the molecular weight of water, we come up with 18 g/mol.
 In 1 mole of water, there are 2 grams of hydrogen and 16 grams of oxygen.
 By weight, we have a percentage of 11% hydrogen and 89% oxygen in one mole
 of water.
 This translates into a ratio of 1:8 of hydrogen to oxygen in water.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Law of Definite Proportions illustrates that whatever the amount of
 water, whether it be 2 moles or 54 grams, the ratio of the amount of hydrogen
 to oxygen by weight will always be the same, just like the egg:sugar:butter
 ratio in chocolate cake should always be the same to maintain consistent
 taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at another compound made up of three atoms this time, such as
 Ethyl Alcohol, which consists of 2 atoms of Carbon, 6 atoms of Hydrogen
 and one atom of Oxygen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the figure, we can calculate the percentage of each element
 in ethyl alcohol by weight, and we come up with 52% carbon, 13% hydrogen
 and 35% oxygen by weight.
 Based on the Law of Definite Proportions, the percentages of carbon, hydrogen
 and oxygen in ethyl alcohol, will always be the same, no matter what the
 amount.

Law of multiple proportions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Law of multiple proportions, also known as Dalton s Law, states that when
 one element combines with another to form more than one compound, the mass
 rations of the elements in the compounds are simple whole numbers of each
 other.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
a) With a few exceptions (i.e., carbonate salts 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

 ) organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds while inorganic chemistry
 is the study of all other compounds.

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer a) is the best fit answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Explaination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Organic and inorganic chemistry are subdisciplines within chemistry.
 In organic chemistry, scientific study is concentrated towards carbon compounds
 and other carbon-based compounds such as hydrocarbons and their derivatives.
 Inorganic chemistry is concerned in the scientific study of all the chemical
 compounds except the carbon group.
 So to cut the story short, organic chemistry deals with carbon while inorganic
 chemistry deals with the rest of the chemical compounds except carbon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
When we say scientific study of organic or inorganic chemistry, this includes
 the study of composition, structure, properties, preparation and study
 of reactions.
 So to think of becoming a chemist, an individual must be expert in all
 of the said processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Organic chemistry tackles photochemistry, stereochemistry, hydrogenation,
 isomerization, polymerization, and fermentation.
 Inorganic chemistry, on the other hand, covers a broad range of subjects.
 Examples of these are: electrochemistry, crystallography, atomic structure,
 coordination of compounds, ceramics, chemical bonding, and acid-base reactions.
 It is always said that organic and inorganic chemistry always overlap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Organic chemistry is said to be an important subdiscipline of chemistry.
 This is due to the fact that they tackle life and the chemical reactions
 related to it.
 They also tackle the vast products that can be produced from it, such as
 the improvement of cleansing products.
 Inorganic chemistry is also an important subdiscipline.
 According to R.T.
 Sanderson, inorganic chemistry is important because it’s the only discipline
 within chemistry that examines specifically the differences among all the
 different kinds of atoms.
 An example of inorganic chemistry in which it can be applied is by the
 use of Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry which studies the significant and
 non-significant elements which can be used in the treatment and diagnosis
 of diseases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
To become an inorganic or organic chemist requires a bachelor’s degree in
 chemistry majoring in organic or inorganic chemistry.
 Then they can further take a Master’s degree or a Doctorate degree for
 them to enhance their knowledge.
 They can also teach in the academy or work in laboratories.
 A chemist can earn as much as $30,000 USD up to $130,000 USD depending
 on the position and expertise as of 2009.
 It is a difficult degree, though, involving patience, analytical and critical
 thinking.

Practice Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Question : What is the origin of the term organic chemistry?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
a) Prior to 1828, most carbon compounds had been found only in living matter
 and it was believed that their natural synthesis required vital force.
 In that year, Friedrich Wohler created Urea from ammonium isocyanate and
 the definitions of organic and inorganic chemistry changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
b) There is no such thing as vital force theory.
 Organic chemistry was ever since the beginning considered the study of
 special carbon compounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
c) The substances not obtained from organs are all inorganic.
 Rest of the compounds are organic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
d) None of these

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Explaination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Before the nineteenth century, chemists generally believed that compounds
 obtained from living organisms were endowed with a vital force that distinguish
ed them from inorganic compounds.
 According to the concept of vitalism (vital force theory), organic matter
 was endowed with a "
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Vital Force Theory
\end_layout

\end_inset

vital force".
 During the first half of the nineteenth century, some of the first systematic
 studies of organic compounds were reported.
 Around 1816 Michel Chevreul started a study of soaps made from various
 fats and alkalis.
 He separated the different acids that, in combination with the alkali,
 produced the soap.
 Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was
 possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally
 come from organic sources), producing new compounds, without "vital force".
 In 1828 Friedrich Wöhler produced the organic chemical urea (carbamide),
 a constituent of urine, from the inorganic ammonium cyanate 
\begin_inset Formula $NH_{4}CNO$
\end_inset

, in what is now called the Wöhler synthesis.
 Although Wöhler was always cautious about claiming that he had disproved
 the theory of vital force, this event has often been thought of as a turning
 point.

\begin_layout Paragraph
In 1856

\end_inset

Perkin's mauve.
 Through its great financial success, this discovery greatly increased interest
 in organic chemistry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The crucial breakthrough for organic chemistry was the concept of chemical
 structure, developed independently and simultaneously by Friedrich August
 Kekulé and Archibald Scott Couper in 1858.Both men suggested that tetravalent
 carbon atoms could link to each other to form a carbon lattice, and that
 the detailed patterns of atomic bonding could be discerned by skillful
 interpretations of appropriate chemical reactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The pharmaceutical industry began in the last decade of the 19th century
 when the manufacturing of acetylsalicylic acid—more commonly referred to
 as aspirin—in Germany was started by Bayer.
 The first time a drug was systematically improved was with arsphenamine
 (Salvarsan).
 Though numerous derivatives of the dangerous toxic atoxyl were examined
 by Paul Ehrlich and his group, the compound with best effectiveness and
 toxicity characteristics was selected for production.

Polymer
\end_layout

\end_inset

polymer is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated
 subunits.
 Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural
 polymers play an essential and ubiquitous role in everyday life.
 Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to
 natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological
 structure and function.
 Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of
 many small molecules, known as monomers.
 Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds
 produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity,
 and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than
 crystals.

isomer is a molecule with the same chemical formula as another molecule,
 but with a different chemical structure.
 That is, isomers contain the same number of atoms of each element, but
 have different arrangements of their atoms.
 Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties, unless they also have
 the same functional groups.
 There are many different classes of isomers, like positional isomers, cis-trans
 isomers and enantiomers, etc.
 .
 There are two main forms of isomerism structural isomerism and stereoisomerism
 (spatial isomerism).
